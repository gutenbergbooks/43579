<h3><i>INTERNAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
OF INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>SENSATION.</h5>


<p>Having given you this full account of the <i>external</i>
parts of insects, and their most remarkable variations;
I must next direct your attention to such discoveries as
have been made with regard to their <i>Internal Anatomy
and Physiology</i>: a subject still more fertile, if possible,
than the former in wonderful manifestations of the
<span class="smcap">power</span>, <span class="smcap">wisdom</span> and <span class="smcap">goodness</span> of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>.</p>

<p>The vital system of these little creatures, in all its
great features, is perfectly analogous to that of the vertebrate
animals. <i>Sensation</i> and <i>perception</i> are by the
means of <i>nerves</i> and a <i>common sensorium</i>; the <i>respiration</i>
of air is evident, being received and expelled by a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
apparatus; <i>nutrition</i> is effected through a <i>stomach</i>
and <i>intestines</i>; the analogue of the <i>blood</i> prepared by
these organs pervades every part of the body, and from
it are secreted various peculiar substances; <i>generation</i>
takes place, and an intercourse between the sexes, by
means of appropriate <i>organs</i>; and lastly, <i>motion</i> is the
result of the action of <i>muscles</i>. Some of these functions
are, however, exercised in a mode apparently so dissimilar
from what obtains in the higher animals, that upon
a first view we are inclined to pronounce them the effect
of processes altogether peculiar. Thus, though insects
respire <i>air</i>, they do not receive it by the <i>mouth</i>, but
through little orifices in the <i>sides</i> of the body; and instead
of <i>lungs</i>, they are furnished with a system of air-vessels,
ramified <i>ad infinitum</i>, and penetrating to every
part and organ of their frame; and though they are nourished
by a fluid prepared from the food received into
the stomach, this fluid, unlike the blood of vertebrate
animals, is <i>white</i>, and the mode in which it is distributed
to the different parts of the system, except in the case of
the true <i>Arachnida</i>, in which a circulation in the ordinary
way has been detected, is altogether obscure.</p>

<p>In order that you may more clearly understand the
variations that occur in insects, and in what respects
they differ amongst themselves, and from the higher animals,
in the vital functions and their organs, I shall consider
them as to their organs of <i>sensation</i>, <i>respiration</i>,
<i>circulation</i>, <i>nutrition</i>, <i>generation</i>, <i>secretion</i>, and <i>muscular
motion</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Organs of Sensation.</i>&mdash;The nervous system of animals
is one of the most wonderful and mysterious works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>. Its pulpy substance is the <i>visible</i> medium
by which the governing principle<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> transmits its commands
to the various organs of the body, and they move
instantaneously&mdash;yet this appears to be but the conductor
of some higher principle, which can be more immediately
acted upon by the mind and by the will. This
principle, however, whatever it be, whether we call it the
nervous <i>fluid</i>, or the nervous <i>power</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, has not been detected,
and is known only by its effects. The system of
which we are speaking may therefore be deemed the
foundation and root of the animal, the centre from which
emanate all its powers and functions.</p>

<p>Comparative anatomists have considered the nervous
system of animals as formed upon <i>four</i> primary types,
which may be called the <i>molecular</i>, the <i>filamentous</i>, the
<i>ganglionic</i>, and <i>cerebro-spinal</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. The <i>first</i> is where invisible
nervous molecules are dispersed in a gelatinous
body, the existence of which has only been ascertained
by the nervous irritability of such bodies, their fine sense
of touch, their perceiving the movements of the waters
in which they reside, and from their perfect sense of the
degrees of light and heat<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Of this description are the
infusory animals, and the <i>Polypi</i>. The nervous molecules
in these are conjectured to constitute so many ganglions,
or centres of sensation and vitality<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. The <i>second</i>,
the filamentous, is where the nervous system consists of
nervous threads radiating from the mouth, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<i>Radiata</i>, or star-fish and sea-urchins<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. The <i>third</i>, the
ganglionic, is where the nervous system consists of a
series of ganglions connected by nervous threads or a medullary
chord, placed, except the first ganglion, below the
intestines, from which proceed nerves to the various parts
of the body. This system may be considered as divisible
into two&mdash;the <i>proper ganglionic</i>, in which it is ganglionic
with the ganglions arranged in a series with a
double spinal chord. This prevails in the classes <i>Insecta</i>,
<i>Crustacea</i>, <i>Arachnida</i>, &amp;c., and the <i>improper ganglionic</i>,
in which it is ganglionic with the ganglions dispersed
irregularly, but connected by nervous threads, as in the
<i>Mollusca</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. In the <i>fourth</i>, the cerebro-spinal, the nervous
tree may be said to be double, or to consist of <i>two</i>
systems&mdash;the first taking its origin in a brain formed of
two hemispheres contained in the cavity of the head,
from which posteriorly proceeds a spinal marrow, included
in a dorsal vertebral column. These send forth
numerous nerves to the organs of the senses and the
muscles of the limbs. The second consists of two principal
ventral chords, which by their ganglions, but without
any direct communication, anastomose with the spinal
nerves and some of those of the brain, and run one on
each side from the base of the skull to the extremity of
the <i>sacrum</i>. This system consists of an assemblage of
nervous filaments bearing numerous ganglions, from
which nervous threads are distributed to the organs of
nutrition and reproduction<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Its chords are called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<i>great sympathetic</i>, the <i>intercostal</i>, or <i>trisplanchnic</i> nerves<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.
While the first of these two systems is the messenger of
the will, by means of the organs of the senses connects
us with the external world, and is subject to have its
agency interrupted by sleep or disease<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; the latter is
altogether independent of the will and of the intellect,
is confined to the internal organic life, its agency continues
uninterrupted during sleep, and is subject to no
paralysis. While the former is the seat of the intellectual
powers, the latter has no relation to them, but is the
focus from whence <i>instincts</i> exclusively emanate: from it
proceed spontaneous impulses and sympathies, and those
passions and affections that excite the agent to acts in
which the will and the judgement have no concern<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>It is probable, though the above appear to exhibit
the <i>primary</i> types of nervous systems, that others exist
of an <i>intermediate</i> nature, with which future investigators
may render us better acquainted<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>: but as our business
is solely with that upon which <i>insects</i> in this respect
have been modelled, without expatiating further in
this interesting field, I shall therefore now confine myself
to them.</p>

<p>We have before seen<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that the nervous system of insects
belongs to the <i>ganglionic</i> type: but it requires a
more full description, and this is the place for it. It originates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
in a small brain placed in the head, and consisting
almost universally of two lobes, sometimes extremely
distinct. It is placed over or upon the <i>&#339;sophagus</i> or gullet,
and from its posterior part proceeds a double nervous
chord, which embracing that organ as a collar dips
below the intestines, and proceeds towards the anus, forming
knots or ganglions at intervals, in many cases corresponding
in number with the segments of the body,
and sending forth nerves in pairs, the ramifications of
which are distributed to every part of the frame. In the
perfect insect the bilobed ganglion of the head or the
brain is usually of greater volume than in the larva, and
the ganglions of the spinal chord are fewer, which gives
a more decided character of <i>centricity</i> to the whole nervous
system<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. This may be considered more particularly
with respect to its <i>substance</i> and <i>colour</i>; its <i>tunics</i>, and
<i>parts</i>.</p>

<p>I. <i>Substance and Colour.</i>&mdash;The nervous apparatus of
insects is stated by those who have examined it most
narrowly, though consisting of a cortical and medullary
part, the latter more delicate and transparent than the
former, to be less tender and less easy to separate than
the human brain<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. It has a degree of tenacity, and
does not break without considerable tension; in general, it
is clammy and flabby, and under a microscope a number
of minute grains are discoverable in it, and when left to
dry upon glass, it appears to contain a good deal of oil,
which does not dry with the rest<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. That of the ganglions
differs from the substance of the rest of the spinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
chord, in being filled with very fine aërial vessels, which
are not discoverable in the latter<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. With regard to <i>colour</i>,
Lyonet states that the chords of the spinal marrow
in the larva of the great goat-moth are of a blueish
gray, and have some transparence<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; Malpighi and
Swammerdam observed that the cortical part of the ganglions
of that of the silk-worm and the hive-bee had a reddish
hue, while the medullary part was white<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; Cuvier
relates that the brain and the third ganglion in <i>Hypogymna
dispar</i>, with us a scarce moth, differed in colour
from all the rest, being quite white, while the others
were more or less tinted, and examined under a lens appeared
variegated by reddish sinuous markings, resembling
blood vessels as they are seen in injected glands<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>II. <i>Tunics.</i>&mdash;The coats that inclose the various branches
of the nervous system in insects seem analogous to those
of vertebrate animals. The first thing that strikes the
eye, when these parts in a recent subject are submitted
to a microscope, is a tissue of very delicate vessels, which
ramify beyond the reach of the assisted sight; these are
merely air-vessels or <i>bronchiæ</i> derived originally from
the <i>tracheæ</i> of the animal: but besides these is an exterior
and an interior tunic; the first corresponding with
the <i>dura mater</i> of anatomists; and the other, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the most delicate and incloses the cortical and medullary
parts, with the <i>pia mater</i><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>III. <i>Parts.</i>&mdash;The nervous system of insects consists
of the <i>brain</i>; the <i>spinal marrow</i> and its <i>ganglions</i>; and
the <i>nerves</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Brain</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Linné denied the existence of a <i>brain</i> in
insects, and most modern physiologists seem to be of the
same opinion. A part however, analogous to this important
organ&mdash;at least in its situation, and in its emission of
nerves to the principal organs of the <i>senses</i>, in which respect
it certainly differs very materially from the upper
cervical ganglion, which Dr. Virey regards as its analogue<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;is
certainly to be found in them; and as Messrs.
Cuvier and Lamarck distinguish this part by the name
of <i>brain</i>, we may continue to call it by that name without
impropriety. The <i>brain</i> of insects, then, is distinguished
from the succeeding ganglions of the spinal chord
by its <i>situation</i> in the head, the middle of the internal
cavity of which it occupies, and by being the only ganglion
<i>above</i> the &#339;sophagus. It is usually small, though
in some cases larger than they are<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. It consists of two
lobes, more or less distinct and generally of a spherical
form. In <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i> and <i>Pontia Brassicæ</i> the
lobes are separated both before and behind<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>; while in
the larva of <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>, but not in the imago, in
which there are two large hemispheres separated by a
furrow, the brain is undivided<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. Cuvier mentions the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
larva of a saw-fly in which this part is formed of <i>four</i>
nearly equal spherical bulbs<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>: in the Scorpion (to judge
by the figure of Treviranus<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>) the two lobes represent
an equilateral triangle, the exterior angle of which terminates
in several lesser spherical bulbs; in <i>Acrida viridissima</i>,
<i>Nepa cinerea</i>, <i>Clubiona atrox</i>, and the common
Louse, the lobes are pear-shaped<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>ii. <i>The spinal marrow and its ganglions</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. From the
<i>posterior</i> part of the brain of insects, but in the ground
and water beetles (<i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i> and <i>Eunech</i>in<i>a</i>) from its
<i>sides</i> below<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, issue two chords which diverging embrace
the <i>&#339;sophagus</i>, and dipping below it and the intestines,&mdash;a
situation they maintain to the end of their course,&mdash;and
in their further progress uniting at intervals and
dilating into several knots or ganglions, compose their
spinal marrow. This part is so named, from a supposed
analogy to the spinal marrow of vertebrate animals,
which however admits of some degree of doubt; yet,
since it mixes the functions of that organ with those of
the great sympathetic nerves, the denomination is not
wholly improper, and may be retained. Though this
chord is usually <i>double</i> when it first proceeds from the
brain, and surrounds the <i>&#339;sophagus</i> like a collar, yet in
some insects it may be called a <i>single</i> chord. This is
the case with that of the common louse, in which Swammerdam
could perceive no opening for the transmission
of the part just named<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>; if he was not mistaken in this,
the brain, as well as the rest of the spinal marrow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that animal, would be below the intestines; from the
figures of Treviranus it should seem that the spiders, at
least <i>Clubiona atrox</i>, are similarly circumstanced<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; in
the cheese-maggot, which turns to a two-winged fly
(<i>Tyrophaga Casei</i>), the chord is also single, but it has
a small orifice through which the gullet passes<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. At
the union of the chords in other cases below that organ,
a knot or ganglion is usually formed, and an alternate
succession of internodes and ganglions commonly follows
to the end. The internodes also may generally be
stated to consist of a <i>double</i> chord, though in many
cases the two chords unite and become one, or are distinguished
only by a longitudinal furrow, and even where
they are really distinct and separable, in the body of the
insect they lie close together<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. In the rhinoceros beetle
(<i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>) and <i>Acrida viridissima</i> &amp;c. <i>all</i> the internodes
consist of a double chord<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; but in many other
insects numerous variations in this respect occur.&mdash;Thus
in the stag-beetle the <i>last</i> internode is single<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>; in the caterpillar
of the cabbage butterfly (<i>Pontia Brassicæ</i>) the
<i>five first</i> are double, and the <i>six last</i> single<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>; in that of the
great goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) the <i>three first</i> only are
double, but the others terminate in a fork<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>; in the cockroaches
(<i>Blatta</i>) the <i>four first</i>, in <i>Hydrophilus piceus</i> the
<i>three first</i>, and in <i>Eristalis tenax</i> the <i>two first</i> only are
double, the rest being all single<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. A singular variation
takes place in <i>Hypogymna dispar</i>; <i>all</i> the internodes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
single, except the <i>second</i>, the chords of which at first are
separate, and afterwards united<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>; and, to name no more,
in <i>Clubiona atrox</i> there is only <i>one</i> internode, which is
single, with a longitudinal furrow<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. In some, as in the
louse, the grub of <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>, and the cheese-maggot,
there are no internodes, the spinal marrow being
formed of knots separated only by slight or deep constrictions<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<p>I must next say something of the <i>ganglions</i><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. Lyonet
has observed that, in the caterpillar of the great goat-moth,
these in one respect differ remarkably from the
chords that connect them; in the latter the air-vessels or
bronchiæ only cover the <i>outside</i> of the tunic, while in the
former they enter the <i>substance</i> of the ganglion, which is
quite filled with their delicate and numberless branches<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.
Every ganglion may be regarded in some degree as a centre
of vitality or little brain<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, and in many cases, as well
as the brain, they are formed of two lobes<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. I shall now
consider them more particularly as to their <i>station</i>, <i>number</i>,
and <i>shape</i>.</p>

<p>1. With regard to the first head, their <i>station</i>, they
are most commonly divided between the trunk and abdomen;
but in some cases, as in <i>Hydrophilus piceus</i> and
<i>Acrida viridissima</i>, the <i>first</i> ganglion is in the <i>head</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>;
in others, as in the louse, the water-scorpion, and the
grub of the rhinoceros-beetle, they are confined to the
<i>trunk</i>, their functions in the abdomen being supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
by numerous radiating nerves<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; in others again, as in
the scorpion, they are all <i>abdominal</i>. The ganglions
vary also in their situation with respect to each other.
Thus in some, as in the larva of the Chamæleon-fly
(<i>Stratyomis Chamæleon</i>), they are so near as to appear
like a string of beads<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>; in that of the ant-lion (<i>Myrmeleon</i>)
the two ganglions of the trunk are separated by an
interval from those of the abdomen, which are so contiguous
as to resemble the rattle of the rattle-snake<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. In
others the internodes are longer, and the ganglions occur
at nearly equal intervals, as in the larva of the <i>Ephemeræ</i><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>;
but in the majority they are unequal in length:
thus in the scorpion the three first ganglions are the most
distant<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; in the hive-bee the third and fourth<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>; and in
the spider the last<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>2. The ganglions also in different species, and often
in the same insect in its different states, vary in their
<i>number</i>. Thus in the grub of the rhinoceros-beetle the
whole spinal marrow appears like a <i>single</i> ganglion divided
only by transverse furrows<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>; in the water-scorpion
there are <i>two</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; in the louse there are <i>three</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>; in the rhinoceros-beetle
there are <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>; <i>five</i> in the stag-beetle<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<i>seven</i> in the hive-bee and some <i>Lepidoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>; <i>eight</i> in the
grub of the stag-beetle<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>; <i>nine</i> in the great <i>Hydrophilus</i><a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>;
<i>ten</i> in <i>Dytiscus</i><a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>; <i>eleven</i> in the grub of the great <i>Hydrophilus</i><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>;
<i>twelve</i> in the grub of <i>Dytiscus</i> and the caterpillars
of <i>Lepidoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; <i>thirteen</i> in the larva of <i>Æshna</i><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>;
and <i>twenty-four</i> in <i>Scolopendra morsitans</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. You must
observe that, generally speaking, the number of ganglions
is less in the <i>imago</i> than in the <i>larva</i>. With regard to
the distribution of these knots to the different primary
parts of the body, the following table will exhibit it, as
far as I am acquainted with it, at one view. I omit those
in which the ganglions are only in <i>one</i> of these parts.</p>

<p>3. I am next to say a few words upon the <i>shape</i> of the
ganglions. Most commonly it approaches to a <i>spherical</i>
figure, but in many instances, as I said before, they, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
well as the brain, consist of <i>two</i> lobes: they are, however,
seldom all precisely of the same shape. In the <i>Dytisci</i>,
and <i>Carabi</i>, the last is marked with a transverse furrow,
which seems to indicate the reunion of two<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>; in the stag-beetle,
the first ganglion is oval or elliptical, the second
hexagonal; the third and fourth shaped like a crescent,
and the last like an olive<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; in the caterpillar of the great
goat-moth the first is oblong and constricted in the middle,
and the seven last are rhomboidal<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>; in the great
<i>Hydrophilus</i> the <i>second</i>, and in the silk-worm <i>all</i> the ganglions
are quadrangular<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>; in <i>Hypogymna dispar</i> the
<i>third</i> is heart-shaped<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>; the great ganglion which forms
the spinal marrow of the cheese-maggot is pear-shaped<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>;
that of the grub of the rhinoceros-beetle is fusiform<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>;
and in the scorpion all the ganglions are lenticular<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.
But the most remarkable in this respect are those of a
spider (<i>Clubiona atrox</i>): in this insect the brain sits upon
a bilobed ganglion of the ordinary form, which is immediately
followed without any internode by another bilobed
one, terminating on each side in four pear-shaped
processes or fingers, which give it a very singular appearance<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>iii. The <i>nerves</i><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> of insects, as of other animals, are
white filaments running from the brain and spinal marrow
to every part of the body which they are destined to
animate; and their numerous ramifications, when delineated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
form no unpleasing picture<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. In the caterpillar
of the goat-moth the accurate Lyonet counted <i>forty-five</i>
pairs of them, and <i>two</i> single ones, making in all
<i>ninety-two</i> nerves; whereas in the <i>human</i> body anatomists
count only <i>seventy-eight</i><a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. From the brain issue several
pairs, which go to the <i>eyes</i>, <i>antennæ</i>, <i>palpi</i>, and other
parts of the mouth: sometimes those that render to the
mandibles issue from the first ganglion, as in the larva
of <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>, the stag-beetle, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>; those both
of <i>mandibles</i> and <i>palpi</i> in the great <i>Hydrophilus</i><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>; and
in <i>Blatta</i> some which act also upon the <i>antennæ</i><a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>optic</i> are usually the most conspicuous and remarkable
of the nerves. In some insects with large eyes,
as many <i>Neuroptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, and <i>Diptera</i>, their
size is considerable; in the hive-bee they present the appearance
of a pair of kidney-shaped lobes, larger than
the brain<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>; in the dragon-flies, whose brain consists of
two very minute lobes, these nerves dilate into two large
plates of a similar shape, which line all the inner surface
of the eyes<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>; in the stag-beetle they are pear-shaped, and
terminate in a bulb, from which issue an infinity of minute
nerves<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>; it is probable that this takes place in all
cases, and that a separate nerve renders to every separate
lens in a compound eye<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>; the optic nerve in <i>Dytiscus</i> and
<i>Carabus</i> is pyramidal, with the base of the pyramid at the
eye and the summit at the brain<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>; in <i>Eristalis tenax</i> it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
is very large, cylindrical, and of a diameter equal to the
length of the last-mentioned part, upon the side of which
it is supported; it terminates in a very large bulb corresponding
to the eye<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>: in <i>Scolopendra morsitans</i> the
optic nerves divide into four branches long before they
arrive at the eyes, and in this insect the nerves which
render to the antennæ are so thick as to appear portions
of the brain, which they equal in diameter<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. Swammerdam
discovered in the grub of the rhinoceros-beetle and
in the caterpillar of the silk-worm, a pair of nerves which
he regarded as analogous to the <i>recurrent nerves</i> in the
human subject, and therefore he distinguishes them by
the same name<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>: they issue from the lower surface of the
brain, or that which rests on the <i>&#339;sophagus</i>, and at first
go towards the mouth, but afterwards turn back, and
uniting form a small ganglion; this produces a single
nerve, which passing below the brain follows the &#339;sophagus
to the stomach, where it swells into another ganglion,
from which issue some small nerves that render to
the stomach, and one more considerable which accompanies
the intestinal canal, producing at intervals lateral
filaments which lose themselves in the tunics of that tube<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.
Lyonet afterwards discovered these nerves in the caterpillar
of the goat-moth<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>, and Cuvier in other insects<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.</p>

<p>The other nerves which issue from the brain exhibit
no remarkable features. Those which originate in the
spinal marrow are mostly derived from the ganglions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
are sometimes interwoven with the muscles, as the woof
with the warp in a piece of cloth<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; those from the three
or four first commonly rendering to the muscles of the
legs, wings, and other parts of the <i>trunk</i>, and those from
the remainder to the <i>abdomen</i>. After their origin they
often divide and subdivide, and terminate in numerous
ramifications that connect every part of the body with
the <i>sensorium commune</i>. A <i>pair</i> of nerves is the most
usual number that proceeds from each side of a ganglion<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>;
but this is by no means constant, since in the
louse, the hive-bee, and several other insects, only a <i>single</i>
nerve thus proceeds<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>; and in the larva of <i>Ephemeræ</i>,
while <i>two</i> pairs issue from the <i>six first</i> ganglions, only a
<i>single</i> one is emitted by the <i>five last</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. In the spinal marrow
of the rhinoceros-beetle, both larva and imago, the
nerves consist of simple filaments which diverge like rays
in all directions<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>: the same circumstance distinguishes the
cheese-maggot, only some of the nerves appear to branch
at the end<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>: in the louse, the last ganglion sends forth
posteriorly three pairs of nerves which render to the
abdomen<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. Sometimes, though rarely, nerves originate
in the <i>internodes</i> of the spinal marrow. Cuvier indeed
has asserted that in invertebrate animals <i>all</i> the nerves
spring from the ganglions, and never immediately from
the spinal marrow; but Swammerdam, in describing
those of the silk-worm, mentions and figures four pairs
as proceeding from the four anterior internodes, excluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the first<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>; and at the same time he gives it as his
opinion, that all the nerves in insects really originate
from the marrow itself, and not from the ganglions, which
he asserts are of a different substance, and are inclosed
in the marrow for the sake of giving it greater firmness<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.
In this opinion, however, he seems singular<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. Those remarkable
nerves described by Lyonet under the name
of <i>spinal bridle</i> (<i>bride épinière</i>) also take their origin, not
from the ganglions, but from a bifurcation of the spinal
marrow. Of these, in the caterpillar of the goat-moth
there are <i>ten</i>, the first issuing from the bifurcation of
the internode between the fourth and fifth ganglions, and
the remainder from the succeeding ones. After approaching
the succeeding ganglion, these nerves form a pair of
branches that diverge nearly at right angles from the
bridle, and producing several lesser branches, lose themselves
in the sides of the animal<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. Besides the nerves
above mentioned, two generally issue from the posterior
part of the last ganglion, diverging in opposite and
oblique directions: some of these render to the parts of
generation; and in the silk-worm, and probably other
species, the innermost pair is perforated for the passage
of the <i>vasa deferentia</i><a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>After duly considering this general outline of the nervous
system of insects, the question will continually occur
to you,&mdash;is then what you have called the <i>brain</i> the
<i>sensorium commune</i> of these animals, in the same manner
as it is in those with warm blood? To this query a negative
must be returned. In the latter, the brain is the
common centre to which, by means of the nerves and
spinal marrow, all the sensations of the animal are conveyed,
and in which all its perceptions terminate. The
nerves and spinal marrow are merely the <i>roads</i> by which
the sensations travel; and if their communication with
the brain, by any means be cut off at the neck, the whole
trunk of the animal becomes paralytic, evidently proving
that the organ by which it feels is the brain. This, however,
is so far from being the case in insects, that in them,
if the head be cut off, the remainder of the body will
continue to give proofs of life and sensation longer than
the head: both portions will live after the separation,
sometimes for a considerable period; but the largest will
survive the longest, and will <i>move</i>, <i>walk</i>, and occasionally
even <i>fly</i>, at first almost as actively without the head, as
when united to it. Lyonet informs us, that he has seen
motion in the body of a wasp <i>three</i> days after it had been
separated from the head; and that a caterpillar even
<i>walked</i> some days after that operation; and when touched,
the headless animal made the same movements as when
intire<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. Dr. Shaw has observed&mdash;an observation confirmed
in Unzer's <i>Kleine Schriften</i>,&mdash;that if <i>Geophilus
electricus</i> be cut in two, the halves will live and appear
vigorous even for a <i>fortnight</i> afterwards; and what is
more remarkable, that the <i>tail</i> part always survives the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
<i>head</i> two or three days<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. The <i>sensorium commune</i> of insects,
therefore, does not, as in the warm-blooded animals,
reside in the brain alone, but in the spinal marrow
also. It was on this account probably that Linné denied
the existence of a <i>brain</i> in insects, regarding it merely
as the first ganglion of the spine.</p>

<p>Cuvier and other modern physiologists, from the ganglionic
structure of this organ, are of opinion that it is
not the analogue of the <i>cerebro-spinal</i> system of vertebrate
animals, but rather of their <i>great sympathetic</i> nerves.
Indeed, considering solely the <i>external</i> structure of the
nervous system of insects, a great resemblance strikes us
between it and these nerves; for besides its general ganglionic
structure, there is also in them an <i>upper</i> ganglion
in the neck, seemingly corresponding with what we have
named the brain of insects, from which the nervous chord
dips to the lower part of the neck, where it forms a <i>second</i>
ganglion, which appears to correspond with what
we have considered as their second ganglion<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. We may
observe, however, that at least in one respect there is
even an <i>external</i> resemblance between the brain of insects
and that of vertebrate animals:&mdash;it most commonly
consists, as has been stated, like them, of two lobes, often
very distinct; a circumstance which not unfrequently
distinguishes the other ganglions<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, and is not borrowed
from the ganglions of the great sympathetics. With respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to the internal structure of the ganglions and spinal
marrow of insects, we know little to build any theory
upon, except that the internal substance of the former is
filled with air-vessels; at least so Lyonet, as has been
already observed, found in the goat-moth, while only
the tunics of the latter are covered by them. Taking
the above resemblance to the brain of vertebrates into
consideration, there appears ground for thinking that
the nervous system of insects, like some of their articulations<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>,
is of a <i>mixed</i> kind, combining in it both the cerebro-spinal
and the ganglionic systems; and this will
appear further if we consider its <i>functions</i>.</p>

<p>That learned and acute physiologist Dr. Virey, assuming
as an hypothesis, that the structure of the system
in question is simply ganglionic, and merely analogous to
the sympathetic system of vertebrate animals, has built
a theory upon the assumption, which appears evidently
contradicted by facts. Because, as he conceives after
Cuvier, insects are not gifted with a real brain and spinal
marrow, he would make it a necessary consequence that
they have no degree of <i>intellect</i>, no memory, judgement
or free will; but are guided in every respect by instinct
and spontaneous impulses,&mdash;that they are incapable of
instruction, and can superadd no acquired habits to those
which are instinctive and inbred<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. This consequence
would certainly necessarily follow, was their nervous
system perfectly analogous to the sympathetic of warm-blooded
animals. But when we come to take into consideration
the <i>functions</i> that in insects this system confessedly
discharges, we are led to doubt very strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the correctness of the assumption. Now in these animals
the system in question not only renders to the nutritive
and reproductive organs, which is the principal
function of the great sympathetic nerves in the vertebrates;
but by the common organs maintains a connexion
with the external world, and acquires ideas of things
without, which in them is a function of the cerebral system:
from the same centre also issue those powers which
at the bidding of the will put the limbs in action, which
also belongs to the cerebral system. That insects have
memory, and consequently a real brain, has been before
largely proved, as also that they have that degree of intellect
and judgement which enables them to profit by the
notices furnished by their senses<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. What can be the use
of eyes,&mdash;of the senses of hearing, smelling, feeling, &amp;c.
if they are not instructed by them what to choose and
what to avoid? And if they <i>are</i> thus instructed&mdash;they
must have sufficient intellect to apprehend it, and a portion
of free will to enable them to act according to it.
With regard to the assertion that they are incapable of
instruction, or of acquiring new habits; few or no experiments
have been tried with the express purpose of
ascertaining this point: but some well-authenticated facts
are related, from which it seems to result that insects
may be taught some things, and acquire habits not instinctive.
They could scarcely be brought from their
wild state, and domesticated, as bees have been so universally,
and both ants and wasps occasionally<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>, without
some departure from the habits of their wild state; and
the fact of the corsair-bees, that acquire predatory habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
before described<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>, shows this more evidently: but one
of the most remarkable stories to our purpose upon record,
is that of M. Pelisson, who, when he was confined
in the Bastile, tamed a spider, and taught it to come for
food at the sound of an instrument. A manufacturer
also in Paris, fed 800 spiders in an apartment, which
became so tame that whenever he entered it, which he
usually did bringing a dish filled with flies but not always,
they immediately came down to him to receive
their food<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>All these circumstances having their due consideration
and weight, it seems, I think, most probable, that as insects
have their communication with the external world
by means of certain organs in connexion with their nervous
system, and appear to have some degree of intellect,
memory, and free will, all of which in the higher
animals are functions of a cerebral system, and at the
same time in other respects manifest those which are
peculiar to the sympathetic system,&mdash;it is most probable,
I say, as was above hinted, that in their system <i>both</i> are
<i>united</i>.</p>

<p>I must bespeak your attention to a circumstance connected
with the subject of this letter, which merits particular
consideration: I mean the gradual change that
takes place in the nervous system when insects undergo
their metamorphoses; so that, except in the <i>Orthoptera</i>,
<i>Hemiptera</i>, and <i>Neuroptera</i> Orders, in which no change
is undergone, the number of ganglions of the spinal chord
is less in the imago than in the larva. There seems an
exception indeed to this rule in the case of the rhinoceros-beetle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in the larva of which there is only <i>one</i> ganglion,
while in the imago there are <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. But as this one
ganglion occupies the whole spinal marrow, it is really
of greater extent than the four of the imago; so that
even in this case there is a concentration of the cerebral
pulp. In some cases, as in <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>, and <i>Hydrophilus
piceus</i><a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>, the imago has only <i>one</i> ganglion less
than the larva, but more generally it loses <i>four</i> or <i>five</i>.
Dr. Herold has traced the gradual changes that take
place in the spinal marrow of the common cabbage-butterfly
(<i>Pontia Brassicæ</i>), from the time that it has attained
its full size to its assumption of the imago. Of these I
shall now give you some account.</p>

<p>In the full-grown caterpillar, besides the brain there
are <i>eleven</i> ganglions, the chords of the four first internodes
being double, and the rest single: from each ganglion
proceed two pairs of nerves, one from each side.
In this the lobes of the brain form an angle with each
other<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. In two days the double chords mutually recede,
so as to diminish the interval between the ganglions, and
the single ones have become curved: thus the length of
the spinal marrow is shortened about a <i>fourth</i>, and the
fourth and fifth ganglions have made an approach to
each other<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. On the eighth day, when the insect has
assumed the pupa but remains still in the skin of the caterpillar,
the flexure of the internodes is much increased;
the first ganglion is now united to the brain, and the
fourth and fifth have joined each other, though they are
still distinct; the spinal marrow has now lost considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
more than a <i>third</i> of its length<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. On the fourteenth
day, the internodes, except the double ones, have become
nearly straight again; the fourth and fifth ganglions
have coalesced so as to form one, and the sixth
and seventh have each lost their pairs of nerves<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. Shortly
after this, these last ganglions have nearly disappeared,
and the chords of the three first internodes have again
approached each other<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. The next change exhibited
is the absorption of the first ganglion by the brain, the
union of the chords of the first internode, which is now
straight, the approximation of the second and third ganglions,
and the enlargement of the one formed by the
union of the fourth and fifth, at the expense perhaps of
the sixth and seventh, which have now intirely disappeared,
and in their place is a very long internode.
These united ganglions retain the pairs of nerves they
had when separate<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. Just before the assumption of the
<i>imago</i>, the direction of the lobes of the brain becomes
horizontal, the second and third ganglions unite, and the
internode between the third and fourth is shortened<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.
Lastly, when the animal is become a butterfly, the second
and third ganglions have coalesced, and are joined
to that formed by the union of the fourth and fifth; a
short isthmus or rather constriction, with an orifice,
being their only separation: each of these united ganglions
send forth laterally four pairs of nerves<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. In his
figure, Dr. Herold has not represented the orifice for
the passage of the gullet, but doubtless one exists, which
for an animal that imbibes only fluid food is probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
very minute. In <i>Hypogymna dispar</i>, we learn from Cuvier,
this orifice is of that description, and of a triangular
shape<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<p>It can admit of no reasonable doubt that one of the
principal intentions of these changes is to accommodate
the nervous system to the altered functions of the animal
in its new stage of existence, in which the antennæ,
eyes, and other organs of the senses, as well as the limbs
and muscles moving them, and the sexual organs, being
very different from those of the larva, and if not wholly
new, yet expanded from minute germs to their full size,
may well demand corresponding changes in the structure
of the nervous system by which they are acted
upon.</p>

<p>But are these changes also concerned, as Dr. Virey
conjectures, in producing that remarkable alteration
which usually takes place between the <i>instincts</i> of the
larva and imago? In order to answer this question, it
will be requisite first to quote the ingenious illustration
with which this able physiologist elucidates his ideas on
this point. "The more readily," he observes, "to comprehend
the action of instinct, let us compare the insect
to one of those hand-organs in which a revolving cylinder
presents different tunes noted at its surface, and
pressing the keys of the pipes of the organ, gives birth to
all the tones of a song: if the tune is to be changed, the
cylinder must be pulled out or pushed in one or more
notches, to present other notes to the keys. In the same
manner let us suppose that nature has impressed or engraved
certain determinations or notes of action, fixed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
a determinate series in the nervous system and the ganglions
of the caterpillar, by which alone she lives, she
will act according to a certain sequence of operations;
and, so to speak, she will sing the air engraven within
her. When she undergoes her metamorphosis into a
butterfly, her nervous system being, if I may so express
myself, pulled out a notch, like the cylinder, will present
the notes of another tune, another series of instinctive
operations; and the animal will even find itself as perfectly
instructed and as capable of employing its new organs,
as it was to use the old ones. The relations will
be the same; it will always be the play of the instrument<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>."</p>

<p>This illustration is doubtless at the first glance very
striking and plausible: but a closer examination will, I
think, show, that, as in so many other instances in metaphysical
reasoning, when fanciful analogies are substituted
for a rigid adherence to stubborn facts, it is satisfactory
only on a superficial view, and will not stand the
test of investigation; and as this is a question intimately
connected with what I have advanced on the subject of
instinct in a former letter, I must be permitted to go
somewhat into detail in considering it.</p>

<p>To prove his position, Dr. Virey ought at least to be
able to show that, whenever a change takes place in the
instincts of insects in their different states of larva and
imago, a corresponding change takes place in the external
structure of the nervous chord. But what are the
facts? In three whole orders, viz. <i>Orthoptera Hemiptera</i>,
and <i>Neuroptera</i>, as mentioned above<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, the structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of the nervous chord is <i>not</i> changed; and yet we
know that many tribes of these orders acquire instincts
in their imago state altogether different from those which
directed them in their state of larvæ. A perfect <i>Locust</i>,
for instance, acquires the new instincts of using its wings;
of undertaking those distant migrations of which so many
remarkable instances were laid before you in a former
letter<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>; and, if a female, of depositing its eggs in an appropriate
situation. But if such striking changes in the
instinct of these tribes can be effected without any perceptible
alteration in the structure of the nervous chord,
it is contrary to the received rules of philosophical induction
to refer to this alteration the changes in the instincts
of other tribes where it is found. Is it not far
more probable that this alteration has in fact no connexion
with the changes of instinct, but is solely concerned
with those remarkable changes in the organs of
sense and motion, which occur in the larva and imago
states of the orders in which it is observed? In a common
caterpillar, the form of the body, the legs, the eyes,
and other organs of the senses, all strikingly differ from
those of the imago; whereas, with the exception of the
acquisition of new wings, a perfect locust differs little
from its larva: so that we may reasonably expect a corresponding
change, such as we find it, in the structure
of the nervous chord of the lepidopterous insect, not
called for in that of the neuropterous species, in which
accordingly it does not take place.</p>

<p>This reasoning, in opposition to Dr. Virey's theory,
that the changes of instinct depend on the altered structure
of the nervous system, becomes greatly strengthened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
when we advert to the higher classes of animals, which
surely in any investigation of the nature of instinct ought
to be closely kept in view; for the faculty, though often
less perfect in them than in insects, is still of the <i>same
kind</i>, and may consequently be expected to follow the
same general laws. In a young swallow, for example,
all its instincts are not developed at once any more than
in an insect. The instinct which leads it to migrate
does not appear for some months after its birth, and that
of building a nest still later. But we have not the slightest
ground for believing that these new instincts are preceded
by any change in the structure of the great sympathetic
nerve, or of any other portion of the nervous
system: and the same may be said as to the sexual instincts
developed in quadrupeds some years subsequent
to their birth. If, then, these remarkable changes in the
instinct of the higher classes of animals can take place
independently of any visible change in the nerves, what
substantial reason can be assigned why they may not
also in the class of insects?</p>

<p>On the whole, I think you will agree with me, that
there is nothing in Dr. Virey's hypothesis which should
lead me to alter the opinion I have already so strongly
expressed in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, as to the insufficiency of
the mechanical theories of instinct hitherto promulgated,
adequately to explain <i>all</i> the phenomena; and unless
they do this they are evidently of small value. Such
theories as I have there adverted to may often seem to
be supported by a few insulated facts, but with others,
far more numerous, they are utterly at variance; and, to
omit many other instances, I am strongly inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
doubt the possibility of satisfactorily explaining the <i>variety</i>
of instincts exercised by a bee<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, or the <i>extraordinary</i>
development of new ones in particular circumstances
only<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, on any merely mechanical grounds.</p>

<p>And after all, even suppose it could be demonstratively
shown that <i>every</i> instinct is as clearly dependent on secondary
causes, as I have formerly admitted that <i>some</i>
doubtless seem to be, yet what would this teach us as
to the essential nature of instinct? We have advanced
indeed a step; but still, as I have before observed in referring
to the theories of Brown and Tucker, we have
only placed the world upon the tortoise, and instinct, as
to its <i>essence</i>, which is what we want to detect, is as mysterious
as ever: just as, though we can clearly prove
that the mind is acted upon by the senses, yet this throws
no light upon the essential nature of the mind, which we
are forced to admit is inscrutable, as if to teach us humility,
and prevent our vainly fancying, that though
allowed to discover some of the arcana of nature, we
shall ever be able to penetrate into her inmost sanctuaries.</p>

<p>That Dr. Virey should regard instinct in insects as
purely mechanical was the natural consequence of his
denying them any portion of intellect; but his opinion
cannot I think be consistently assented to, if it be the
fact, as I have just shown<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>, that they are not wholly devoid
of the intellectual principle. Whatever is merely
mechanical, must, under similar circumstances, always
act precisely in the same way. An automaton once constructed,
whilst its machinery remains in order, will invariably
perform the same actions; and Des Cartes, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
he had constructed his celebrated female automaton,
imagined that he had irrefragably proved his principle,
that brutes are mere machines. But if, instead of losing
himself in the wilds of metaphysical speculation, he had
soberly attended to facts, he would have seen that the
instinct of animals can be modified and counteracted by
their intellect, and consequently cannot be regarded as
simply mechanical. Though the instinctive impulse of
an empty stomach powerfully impel a dog to gratify his
appetite, yet, if he be well tutored, the fear of correction
will make him abstain from the most tempting dainties:
and in like manner a bee will quit the nectary of a flower,
however amply replenished with sweets, if alarmed by
any interruption. The ants on which Buonaparte amused
himself with experiments at St. Helena, though they
stormed his sugar-basin when defended by a fosse of
water, controlled their instinct and desisted when it was
surrounded with vinegar<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>: and in the remarkable instance
communicated to Dr. Leach by Sir Joseph Banks,
the instinct of a crippled spider so completely changed,
that from a sedentary web-weaver it became a hunter<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.
There is evidently, therefore, no analogy between actions
strictly mechanical and instincts, which, though they may
often seem to be excited by mechanical causes, are liable
to be restrained or modified by the connexion of the instinctive
and intellectual faculties<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>; and while we are
ignorant how this connexion takes place, it is obviously
impossible to reason logically on the subject.</p>

<p>In thus denying that any existing <i>mechanical</i> theory of
instinct is satisfactory, I by no means intend to assert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that instinct is purely <i>intellectual</i>. I have already given
you my opinion<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, that it is not the effect of any immediate
agency of the Deity; nor am I prepared to assent
to the doctrine of a writer, who has in some respects
written ably on the subject in question, who says, that
"the Divine Energy does in reality act not <i>immediately</i>,
but <i>mediately</i>, or through the medium of <i>moral</i> and <i>intellectual
influences</i> upon the nature or consciousness of
the creature, in the production of the various, and in
many instances truly wonderful, actions which they perform<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>."
The same objection applies to this as to so
many other metaphysical theories, that it is not adequately
supported by <i>facts</i>; and all theories not so supported
are injurious to science in proportion as their plausibility
is greater, by leading the student to relax in that
observation of nature and attentive study of the instincts
of animals, on which alone sound hypothesis on this
subject can be ultimately founded.</p>

<p>I shall conclude these remarks on the nature of instinct
with a few observations as to the circumstances in
which insects may be supposed to be guided by this faculty,
and those in which <i>intellect</i> seems to direct them.
The bee, when it takes its flight to a field where flowers
abound, is governed by intellect in the use of its senses;
for these are given to it as <i>guides</i>: and when it arrives
there, they direct it to the flowers, and enable it to ascertain
which contains the treasures it is in search of;
but having made this discovery, its instinct teaches it to
imbibe the nectar and load its hind legs with pollen.&mdash;Again:
its senses, aided by memory, enable it to retrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
its way to the hive, where instinct once more impels
it in its various operations. So that when we ascribe
a certain degree of intellect to these animals, we do
not place them upon a par with man; since all the
most wonderful parts of their economy, and those manipulations
that exceed all our powers, we admit not
to be the contrivance of the animals themselves, but
the necessary results of faculties implanted in their
constitution at the first creation by their <span class="smcap">Maker</span>. I
may further repeat, that the mere fact of being endowed
with the external organs of sense, proves a certain
degree of intellect in insects. For if in all their
actions they were directed merely by their instinct, they
might do as well without sight, hearing, smell, touch, &amp;c.
but having these senses and their organs, it seems to
me a necessary consequence, that they must have a sufficient
degree of intellect, memory, and judgement, to
enable them advantageously to employ them.</p>

<p>There is this difference between intellect in man, and
the rest of the animal creation. Their intellect teaches
them to follow the lead of their senses, and make such
use of the external world as their appetites or instincts
incline them to,&mdash;and <i>this is their wisdom</i>; while the intellect
of man, being associated with an immortal principle,
and being in connexion with a world above that
which his senses reveal to him, can, by aid derived from
heaven, control those senses, and bring under his instinctive
appetites, so as to render them obedient to the &#964;&#959; &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957;,
or governing power of his nature: <span class="smcap">and this is
his wisdom</span>.</p>

<h3><i>INTERNAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
OF INSECTS CONTINUED.</i></h3>

<h5>RESPIRATION.</h5>


<p>"Life and flame have this in common," says Cuvier,
"that neither the one nor the other can subsist without
<i>air</i>; all living beings, from man to the most minute vegetable,
perish when they are utterly deprived of that
fluid<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>." The ancients, however, not perceiving insects
to be furnished with any thing resembling <i>lungs</i>, took it
for granted that they did not <i>breathe</i>; though Pliny
seems to hesitate on the subject<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. But the microscopic
and anatomical observations of Malpighi, Swammerdam
and Lyonet, and the experiments of more modern physiologists,
have incontestably proved that insects are provided
with respiratory organs, and that the respiration
of air is as necessary to them as to other animals. They
can exist indeed for a time in irrespirable air; and immersion
in hydrogen or carbonic acid gases is not, as I
have often ascertained, so instantly fatal to them as it
would be to vertebrate animals; but like them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
speedily perish in air altogether deprived of its oxygen,
or placed in situations to which all access to this essential
element is excluded. Their respiration too of atmospheric
air produces the same change in it with that of
the vertebrate animals, the oxygen disappearing, and
carbonic acid gas being produced in its place. Boyle
had long since ascertained, that when bees, flies, and
other insects were placed under an exhausted receiver,
they often perished<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>: and the same effect was even observed
by the ancients to ensue, when their bodies were
by any means covered with oil or grease, which necessarily
closed the orifices of their respiratory organs<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.</p>

<p>But for the first series of experiments ascertaining the
necessity of a supply of air to insects, and their conversion
of it into carbonic acid, we are indebted to the illustrious
Scheele<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>; and his experiments have been repeated
and confirmed by Spallanzani, Vauquelin, and other chemists.
The former found, that when caterpillars and
maggots were confined in vessels containing only about
eleven cubic inches of atmospheric air, though furnished
with sufficient food, they soon died, and sooner when the
space was more confined<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. He ascertained too, that a
larva weighing only a few grains consumed, in a given
time, as much oxygen as an amphibious animal a thousand
times as voluminous<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. A male grasshopper (<i>Acrida
viridissima</i>) in six cubic inches of oxygen lived but
eighteen hours, and the female placed in eight cubic
inches of atmospheric air, only thirty-six hours. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
usual tests in both instances detected the conversion of
the oxygen present into carbonic acid<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. Precisely the
same result was obtained by Sorg and Ellis, who, having
placed a number of flies in nine cubic inches of atmospheric
air, found them all dead by the third day, the
oxygen intirely vanished, and a quantity of carbonic acid
nearly equal in bulk produced<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.</p>

<p>It is ascertained too, that insects like other animals
require in the process of respiration not merely oxygen,
but such a mixture of it with nitrogen or azote as composes
atmospheric air: for Vauquelin found that a grasshopper
placed in six cubic inches of oxygen lived only
half as long (eighteen hours) as another placed in eight
inches of atmospheric air; its breathing was much more
laborious, and it died when not more than one-twentieth
of the oxygen had been converted into carbonic acid<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.
That a large quantity of <i>oxygen</i> penetrates all parts of
insects, is evident also from the <i>acid</i> prevalent in the
fluids of most of them, as likewise from the wonderful
power of their muscles. That <i>azote</i> is also received,
seems probable from the <i>ammonia</i> which has been extracted
from the fluids of many, and from the rapid putrescence
of these animals<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.</p>

<p>The mode, however, in which the respiration of insects
is carried on, differs greatly from that which obtains in
the higher animals. They have no lungs, no organs
confined to a particular part of the body, by means of
which the whole of the blood is regularly exposed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
action of the inspired air. They do not breathe through
the <i>mouth</i>, but through numerous orifices called <i>spiracles</i>,
and the respiratory vessels connected with these are conducted
to every part of the body. In some indeed, that
we have included under the denomination of insects, as
the <i>Arachnida</i>, an approach is made to the branchial
respiration of fishes.</p>

<p>The respiratory apparatus of insects may be considered
under <i>two</i> principal heads:&mdash;viz. the orifices or
spiracles, and other <i>external</i> organs by which the air is
alternately received and expelled; and the <i>internal</i> ones,
by which it is distributed. Each of these is well worthy
of your attention.</p>

<p>I. The <i>external</i> respiratory organs of insects may be
divided into <i>three</i> kinds. <i>Spiracles</i>; <i>Respiratory plates</i>;
and <i>branchiform</i> and <i>other pneumatic appendages</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Spiracles</i><a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> (<i>Spiracula</i>), or breathing pores, are small
orifices in the trunk or abdomen of insects, opening into
the <i>tracheæ</i>, by which the air enters the body, or is expelled
from it<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>. They may be considered principally as
to their <i>composition</i> and <i>substance</i>; <i>shape</i>; <i>colour</i>; <i>magnitude</i>;
<i>situation</i>; and <i>number</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Composition</i> and <i>substance</i>. Perhaps you may not
be aware that the structure of these minute apertures is
not so simple as at the first view it may seem; but when
you recollect that by them the insect <i>breathes</i>, you will
suspect that provision may be made for their opening
and shutting. A spiracle therefore, speaking analogically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
may be regarded in numerous cases as a <i>mouth</i>
closed by <i>lips</i>. In caterpillars and many other insects,
the substance of the crust where it surrounds the spiracle,
is elevated so as to form a ring round it. The lips, properly
speaking, are formed of a single cartilaginous piece
or platform, with a central longitudinal cleft or opening,
when closed often extending the whole length of the
piece<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>; but in some appearing always open and circular:
of the former description are those covered by the
elytra in the common cockchafer; and of the latter, those
that are not so covered: in some, as in the antepectoral
pair of the mole-cricket, there appear to be no lips, the
orifice being merely closed with hairs<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. Though the
aperture is usually in the middle of the platform, in the
female of <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>, it is nearer the posterior
side, the anterior or upper lip being the longest. In the
majority, the mouth or cleft is nearly as long as the spiracle;
yet in the puss-moth (<i>Cerura Vinula</i>) it is shorter<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.
Some spiracles, however, are unilabiate, or have only
<i>one</i> lip. This is the case with <i>Gonyleptes</i> and perhaps
others<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. The lips are usually horizontal, but sometimes
they dip so as to make the spiracle appear open.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>substance</i> of these organs, it is more
or less cartilaginous, and probably elastic; the surface
frequently appears to be corrugate or plaited; this is very
distinctly seen in the stag-beetle and the cockchafer: in
the last insect, under a powerful magnifier, we are told
that the lips appear to consist of parallel cartilaginous
processes, separated by a cellular web<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. In some species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of <i>Copris</i> the corrugations form a perplexed labyrinth;
in the caterpillar of the puss-moth the plaits are so narrow
as to look like rays<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>; and in some <i>Dynastidæ</i> the
lips approach to a lamellated structure. Again, in <i>Hydrophilus
caraboides</i> the <i>upper</i> lip, and in <i>Dytiscus circumflexus</i>,
<i>both</i> lips seem formed of elegant plumes<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>: a
similar ornament distinguishes the inner edge of the lips
in the caterpillar of the great goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>)
and others<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. In the grub of the rhinoceros-beetle
(<i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>) the margin of the lower or inner
lip is decorated by pinnated rays, which enter the
cellular membrane that covers the upper lip<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>: in this
larva, and that likewise of the cockchafer, the two lips
are formed of different substances; in the last the upper
or outer one consists of a perforated cellular membrane,
through which the air can pass, while the lower or inner
one is a cartilaginous valve that closes the orifice<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>: in
the former this valve is surmounted by a boss<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>. In the
pupa of <i>Smerinthus Populi</i>, a hawk-moth not uncommon,
and of some dragon-flies (<i>Libellula depressa</i>), the margin
of the two lips is crenated, probably with notches which
alternate, that the mouth of the spiracle may shut more
accurately<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>. The substance is unusually thick in the spinose
caterpillars of butterflies; and in the pupa of one,
<i>Uria Proteus</i>, it is villose.</p>

<p>Under the present head I may observe, that in some
cases, as in the puss-moth, and the larva of the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
water-beetle (<i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>), the spiracles are closed
by a semifluid substance, which however, according to
Sprengel, is permeable to the air<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. The animal, where
these organs are furnished with lips, has doubtless, by
means of a muscular apparatus, the power of <i>opening</i>
and <i>shutting</i> them: this is done, we are told, by elevating
and depressing, or rather by contracting and relaxing
them. Sorg counted in one case (<i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>)
<i>twenty</i>, and in another (<i>Acrida viridissima</i>) <i>fifty</i>, of these
motions to take place in little more than <i>two</i> minutes<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>:
but the quickness and force of this motion is not always
uniform; for the same physiologist observed, that in
<i>Carabus auratus</i>, when feeding or moving its body rapidly,
the contraction of the spiracles took place at very
short intervals; but when it was fasting, and its motions
were slow, the intervals were longer<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>: it is probable also,
that the temperature may accelerate or retard the motion.
In the summer I examined a specimen of <i>Phyllopertha
horticola</i>, that had indeed been somewhat injured,
with this view: the pulses of the abdomen, which alternately
rose and fell, were at about the rate of the pulse
of a man in health, sixty in a minute, and the spiracles
appeared to me to keep pace with this motion: later in
the year, when the temperature was lower, as I was walking,
I took a specimen of some grasshopper (<i>Locusta</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Upon viewing it under a lens, I observed one of the
convex pectoral spiracles open and shut, and the interval
between two breathings appeared nearly half a
minute.</p>

<p>2. With regard to their <i>shape</i>, spiracles vary considerably.
In general we may observe that the abdominal
ones are usually flat, while those of the trunk are often
convex<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. Sometimes they are very narrow and nearly
linear, as in many pupæ of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and those in
the <i>metathorax</i> of the sand-wasps (<i>Ammophila</i>) and affinities;
at others they are wider and nearly elliptical,
as in <i>Lucanus</i> and many Lamellicorn beetles: again, in
<i>Copris</i> they are circular; in <i>Cordylia Palmarum</i> ovate;
in <i>Dytiscus</i> oblong<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>; in <i>Goerius olens</i> lunulate; in <i>Gonyleptes</i>
nearly of the shape of a horse-shoe<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>; and probably
many other forms might be traced, if a thorough investigation
with this view were undertaken.</p>

<p>3. The <i>colour</i> of spiracles will not detain us long. In
the caterpillars of <i>Lepidoptera</i> this is often so contrasted
with that of the rest of the body, as to produce a
striking and pleasing effect. Thus when the body is of
a <i>dark</i> colour, they are usually of a <i>pale</i> one<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>; or if the
body is <i>pale</i>, they are <i>dark</i><a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>, or surrounded with a dark
ring<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>. This contrast is often rendered more striking by
their position with regard to the partial colours that
often ornament caterpillars: in those whose sides are
decorated by a longitudinal stripe, the spiracles are often
planted in it<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>; or just above it<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>; or between two<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>: in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
some hawkmoths the intermediate ones are set in white
or pale spots, which gives great life to the appearance
of the animal. In general, in perfect insects the most
prevalent colour is buff, or reddish-yellow. In the larva
of the great water-beetle these organs resemble the iris of
the eye, being circular with concentric rings alternately
pale and dark<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>.</p>

<p>4. The <i>size</i> of spiracles varies considerably. Those
in the larva last mentioned are so minute as to be scarcely
visible except under a lens, while those behind the fore-legs
in the mole-cricket are a full line in length, and those
in the <i>pleura</i> of <i>Acrocinus accentifer</i>, a Brazilian Capricorn
beetle, are more than twice as long. In the same
species they are often found of different sizes;&mdash;thus the
<i>anal</i> pairs in the water-beetle lately alluded to, I mean in
the perfect insect, are much larger than the rest<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>, probably
that the animal may imbibe a larger quantity of
air when it rises to the surface of the water, where it
suspends itself by the <i>tail</i>. In those Lamellicorn beetles
in which the terminal part of the abdomen is not
protected by the elytra, the <i>covered</i> spiracles are the
largest.</p>

<p>5. Under the next head, the <i>situation</i> of spiracles, I
shall not only consider the part of the body in which
they are situated, but likewise their <i>position</i> in the crust;
to which last, as it will not detain us long, I shall first
call your attention. Their position in this respect is
most commonly <i>oblique</i>: but in the abdomen of the above
water-beetle they are <i>transverse</i>, and in a larva I possess,
probably of an <i>Elater</i>, they are <i>longitudinal</i>. In spinose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
caterpillars these organs are generally planted between
two spines, one being above and the other below. The
<i>lateral</i> line of the body most commonly marks their situation;
but in many cases they become <i>ventral</i>, and in
others <i>dorsal</i>. The most important circumstance, however,
connected with the present head is their appropriation
to particular segments or parts of the body, for, like
the ganglions of the spinal marrow, they are distributed
to almost every segment. Let us take a summary view
of their arrangement in this respect.</p>

<p>No insect has any spiracle in the <i>head</i>; but in caterpillars
and many other <i>larvæ</i> there is a pair in the <i>first</i>
segment of the trunk. This is also to be found in the
other states, but is not easily detected in the <i>pupæ</i> of
<i>Lepidoptera</i>: in the <i>Coleoptera</i> order, in the grub of the
Lamellicorn beetles, it is extremely conspicuous, and
planted in the side of the first segment<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>; in other Coleopterous
grubs it is not so readily found, but probably its
station is somewhere behind the base of the arms, where
it is very visible in that of the <i>Staphylinidæ</i>. In the
<i>imago</i> of insects of this order, this antepectoral spiracle
has been overlooked, and indeed is not soon discovered:
to see it clearly, the manitrunk should be separated from
the alitrunk; and then if you examine the <i>lower</i> side of
the cavity, you will see a pair of, usually, large spiracles
planted just above the arms, in the ligament that unites
these two parts of the trunk to each other: in the common
rove-beetle, however, (<i>Goerius olens</i>)you may easily
see it without dissection<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> it is situated
behind the arms, as in <i>Gryllotalpa</i>: or between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and the <i>prothorax</i>, as in <i>Blatta</i>: in the <i>Hemiptera</i> and
<i>Neuroptera</i> probably the situation is not very different.
In the <i>Lepidoptera</i> this pair of spiracles is planted just
before the base of the upper or primary wings<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>: a similar
situation, I suspect, is appropriated to it in the <i>Trichoptera</i>,
but covered by a tubercle or scale. Something
similar has been noticed by M. Chabrier, in the same
situation and circumstances, in the collar of <i>Hymenoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.
In numerous <i>Diptera</i> this breathing pore is
planted on each side between the collar and the <i>dorsolum</i>
above the arms<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>, and in <i>Hippobosca</i> in the collar
itself<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>.</p>

<p>In <i>Lepidopterous</i>, <i>Coleopterous</i>, and some other larvæ,
the two segments of the body corresponding with the
alitrunk in the perfect insect, are without spiracles, neither
have they in this state, though pneumatic organs
have been discovered<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>, any real ones in that part: but
not so the <i>remaining</i> orders, all of which have these organs
in that section of the trunk. To begin with the
<i>Orthoptera</i>:&mdash;in <i>Blatta</i> there seems to be a long narrow
one behind the intermediate leg; in the <i>Gryllotalpa</i> there
is one in the posterior part of the <i>pleura</i>; and in <i>Locusta</i>,
above both the intermediate and hind legs<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. It
is probable, that in general those that have <i>no</i> spiracles
in the manitrunk have <i>four</i> in the alitrunk, which
seems the natural number belonging to the trunk. In
many of the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i> in the <i>parapleura</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
there is an open spiracle without lips<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>, to which, as in
that beautiful bug <i>Scutellera Stockeri</i>, a channel sometimes
leads. The space in which this spiracle is planted
in other genera of bugs (<i>Pentatoma</i> &amp;c.) is covered with
a kind of membranous skin, often much corrugated<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>. In
the aquatic insects of this section, and many terrestrial
ones, as <i>Reduvius</i>, &amp;c. this spiracle is obsolete. There
is another circumstance, possibly connected with their
respiration, relating to many of the bugs, which may be
mentioned here. If you examine <i>Pentatoma rufipes</i>, a
very common one, you will find between the <i>scapula</i> and
<i>parapleura</i> a long orifice or chink; this upon a closer
inspection, under a good magnifier, you will see completely
filled with minute stiff hairs or bristles, which
fringe the posterior margin of the <i>scapula</i><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>. In a Brazilian
species of <i>Lygæus</i> (<i>sexmaculatus</i> K. M. S.) with incrassated
posterior thighs, these hairs are replaced by
lamellæ which have the aspect of <i>gills</i>. A red, vertical,
convex spiracle, with its orifice towards the head, and
terminating posteriorly in a kind of conical sac, is situated
towards the hinder part of the <i>pleura</i> in the giant water-scorpion
(<i>Belostoma grandis</i><a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>); this seems analogous to
one lately mentioned in the mole cricket. In the other
section of this Order it is not easy to decipher the parts
of the under side of the alitrunk. In <i>Fulgora</i>, <i>Cicada</i>,
and many others of its genera, there appears to be more
than one opening into the chest; but whether they are of
a pneumatic nature or not, can only be ascertained by an
inspection of the living animal. There is a very visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
spiracle over each of the four last legs of the <i>Libellulina</i><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>,
but in the remainder of the <i>Neuroptera</i> Order they have
eluded my search. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>
they are nearly in the same situation, being placed behind
the wings on each side of the <i>metathorax</i>; in the
latter Order with the poiser near them on the inner side<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>:
in this also, the spiracles of the <i>trunk</i> are without <i>lips</i>,
except in the larvæ, but are often merely an orifice,
sometimes fringed with hairs; this is particularly conspicuous
in <i>Syrphus</i>, in which these orifices are very
large, and in some species closed by an elegant double
fringe of white hairs. This is doubtless to prevent the
entrance of any particles of dust or the like.</p>

<p>We are next to consider the situation of the spiracles
of the <i>abdomen</i>: these which are supposed to be appropriated
exclusively to <i>inspiration</i>, are usually more numerous
than those of the trunk, by which it is probable
that <i>expiration</i> is performed, and have principally attracted
the notice of Entomologists: they are either dorsal,
lateral, or ventral. In <i>Dytiscus</i>, <i>Copris</i>, &amp;c. amongst
the beetles, all the spiracles are <i>dorsal</i>; in the larvæ of
<i>Coleoptera</i> and <i>Lepidoptera</i> they are <i>lateral</i>; and in the
Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i> they are usually <i>ventral</i>: in
<i>Dynastes</i> they are commonly found of all three descriptions;&mdash;the
<i>three</i> first being <i>dorsal</i>, the <i>two</i> next <i>lateral</i>,
and the <i>last</i> pair <i>ventral</i><a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. In some instances, as in
<i>Perga Kirbii</i>, and probably other <i>Hymenoptera</i>, these
organs are planted in that portion of the dorsal segment
which turns under, as was observed in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and becomes ventral. Generally there is a <i>pair</i> of spiracles
to <i>each</i> segment, and in those insects that have a
hypochondriack joint<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> there is often a spiracle in it. The
last segment of the abdomen is always without these
orifices, as is the basal one in <i>Velia</i>, <i>Ranatra</i>, and some
other bugs. A singular anomaly distinguishes the <i>Libellulina</i>:
they appear to have no <i>abdominal</i> spiracles<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>,
yet I have seen the abdomen of <i>Libellula depressa</i> when
reposing, contract and dilate alternately, from whence it
follows that this part is concerned in respiration. Sprengel
says that the larvæ in this tribe have seven or nine
on each side<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>, and Reaumur speaks of them as discoverable
in the pupa<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. I have carefully examined the
pupa-skin of most of the genera of <i>Libellulina</i>, under a
powerful magnifier, but have not succeeded in discovering
any thing like these organs in the abdomen. The
<i>Ephemera</i> and probably the other <i>Neuroptera</i> have abdominal
spiracles<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. M. Latreille observed one on each
side of the base of the scale on the footstalk of the abdomen
in ants<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. Generally the abdominal spiracles may
be described as planted in the <i>crust</i> of the insect; but in
many cases their station is in the membranous folds,
which I have therefore named the <i>pulmonarium</i>, that
sometimes separate the dorsal from the ventral segments:
these folds allow of a considerable distention of the abdomen,
which is probably necessary when all the air-vessels
are full. In a gravid <i>Ichneumon</i> I once saw it enlarged
to more than twice its natural size by means of
this membrane, through which the eggs were distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
visible.&mdash;Before I bid adieu to this subject, I must say a
few words upon the situation of the organs in question
in the <i>myriapods</i>. In <i>Iulus</i>, in each segment is a pair of
orifices which have usually been regarded as spiracles,
but M. Savi found that these orifices opened into vesicles
containing a fetid fluid, and upon a very close examination
he discovered the real spiracles above the base of the
legs, in connexion with <i>tracheæ</i><a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. In some of the larger
species of <i>Scolopendræ</i> large open spiracles in the same
situation are extremely visible<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. <i>Cermatia</i> presents a
singular anomaly:&mdash;a single series of spiracles of the
usual form, each planted in a cleft of the posterior margin
of the dorsal <i>scuta</i>, runs along the back of the animal<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>:
unless we may suppose that, like the seeming spiracles
of <i>Iulus</i> just mentioned, these are merely orifices by which
it covers itself with some secretion.</p>

<p>6. A few words upon the <i>number</i> of spiracles.&mdash;If you
examine the common dog-tick (<i>Ixodes Ricinus</i>), you will
find only <i>one</i> of these organs on each side of the abdomen<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>;
the <i>Libellulina</i>, as we have seen, have only <i>four</i>,
all in the trunk; in the <i>Dynastidæ</i>, <i>Melolontha</i>, and the
larva of <i>Dytiscus</i>, there are <i>fourteen</i>; <i>sixteen</i> in the <i>Copridæ</i>;
<i>eighteen</i> in <i>Dytiscus</i>, and probably the majority
of <i>Coleoptera</i>, both larva and imago, and <i>Lepidoptera</i>;
and a pair to each segment except the last, in the <i>Myriapods</i>.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Respiratory plates</i> (<i>Respiratoria</i>). The nearest approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to spiracles is made by those remarkable plates
that are found in such larvæ of <i>Diptera</i>, as in that state
inhabit substances that might impede or altogether stop
the entrance or exit of the air by the ordinary spiracles,
such as dead or living flesh, dung, or the like. The
<span class="smcap">Creator</span> therefore, as he has seen it good for wise reasons<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
to commission certain insects to feed on unclean
food, has fitted them for the offices that devolve upon
them, and has placed their orifices for breathing in plates
at each extremity of the body. There are usually two
of these plates at the head, and two at the tail. In the
grub of the common flesh-fly (<i>Sarcophaga carnaria</i>), at
the junction of the first segment of the body with the
second, two of these plates are planted, which are concave
and circular, with a denticulated margin; in the
cavity near the lower side is a round spiracle. These
plates the animal can withdraw within the body, so as to
prevent this spiracle from being stopped up by any greasy
substance<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. The posterior extremity of this grub is truncated,
and has a large and deep cavity surrounded by
several fleshy prominences: at the bottom of this are
two oval brown plates, in each of which are <i>three</i> oval
spiracles, placed obliquely: by the contraction of the
fleshy prominences, this cavity also can be closed at the
will of the animal<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. In some cases, several stiff rays or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
spines replace the prominences<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. In <i>Echinomyia grossa</i>
and others the anal plates appear not to be perforated,
being surmounted only by a central boss<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>; but this,
most probably, as in the case of <i>&#338;strus Ovis</i><a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>, is a <i>valve</i>
that closes the respiratory orifices. In the gad-fly of
the ox (<i>&#338;. Bovis</i>) there are no plates at the <i>anterior</i> extremity
of the body; but those planted in the <i>other</i> end
are very remarkable, and demand particular attention.
Each is separated by a curved line into two unequal portions;
the smallest of which is contiguous to the convex
belly, and the largest to the concave back of the animal.
This last is distinguished by two hard, brown, kidney-shaped
pieces, a little elevated with the concave sides
turned towards each other: in this sinus is a <i>single</i>, small,
white spot, which appears to be a spiracle: in the smallest
portion are <i>eight</i> minute circular orifices, arranged in a
line<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. As the only communication which this grub has
with the atmosphere is at its <i>anal</i> extremity, it has no
occasion for respiratory organs at the <i>other</i>. The gad-fly
of the horse (<i>Gasterophilus Equi</i>, &amp;c.) which has no
communication at all with the external air, breathing that
which is received into the stomach, has these plates at
<i>both</i> ends of the body.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Respiratory Appendages</i><a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>. These may be divided
into <i>two</i> kinds; those by which the animal has <i>immediate</i>
communication with the <i>atmosphere</i>, and those by which
it extracts <i>air</i> from <i>water</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>1. To begin with the <i>first</i>. These are often found in
insects which, during their two first states, live in the
water. No better example, nor one more easy to be examined,
of this structure, can be selected, than the gnat
(<i>Culex</i>). You must have occasionally observed in tubs
of rain-water, numerous little wriggling worm-like animals,
which frequently ascend to the surface; there remain
a while, and then bending their head under the
body rapidly sink to the bottom again. These are the
larvæ of some species of the genus just named; and if
you take one out of the water and examine it, you will
perceive that it is furnished near the end of its body with
a singular organ, which varies in length according to the
species, and forms an angle with the last segment but
one<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>. The mouth of this organ is tunnel-shaped, and
terminates in five points like a star; and by this it is
usually suspended at the surface of the water, and preserves
its communication with the atmosphere: in its interior
is a tube which is connected with the <i>tracheæ</i>, and
terminates in several openings, visible under a microscope,
at the mouth of the organ. The points or rays of
the mouth when the animal is disposed to sink in the
water, are used to close it, and cut off its communication
with the atmosphere. When the animal is immersed, a
globule of air remains attached to the end of the tube,
so that it is in fact of less specific gravity than that element,
and it is not without some effort that it descends
to the bottom; but when it wishes to rise again, it has
only to unclose the tube, and it rises without an effort
to the surface, and remains suspended for any length of
time. Its anal extremity is clothed with bunches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
hairs, which are furnished with some repellent material
which prevents their becoming wet<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>: it is this repellent
quality that probably causes a dimple or depression of
the surface, which if you look narrowly you will discover
round the mouth of the tube<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>.</p>

<p>When the gnat undergoes its first change and assumes
the pupa, instead of a <i>single</i> respiratory appendage it is
furnished with a <i>pair</i>, each in shape resembling a cornucopia,
and, what is remarkable, placed near the opposite
extremity of the body, for they proceed from the upper
side of the trunk<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. By these tubular horns, which
Reaumur compares to asses' ears<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>, they respire, and are
suspended at the surface.</p>

<p>Other respiratory tubes or horns are more complex.
The rat-tailed grub of a fly (<i>Helophilus pendulus</i>), like
the gnat, breathes by a tube: but as if the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>
willed to show those whose delight it is to investigate
his works, by how many varying processes he can accomplish
the same end, this respiratory organ is of a
construction totally different from that we have been
considering. It is not fixed to the side of the tail, but
is a continuation of the tail itself, and is composed of two
tubes, the inner one, like the tube of a telescope, being
retractile within the other<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>. The extremity, which is
very slender, and through which the air finds admission
by a pair of spiracles, terminates in five diverging hairs
or rays, which probably maintain it <i>in equilibrio</i> at its
station at the surface<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>. As these larvæ seek their food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
amongst the mud at the bottom of shallow pools, in
which they are constantly employed, they require an apparatus
capable of being lengthened or shortened, to suit
the depth of the water, that they may maintain their
necessary communication with the atmosphere; and for
this purpose a <i>single</i> tube would not have been sufficient:
therefore <span class="smcap">Providence</span> has furnished them with <i>two</i>, and
both are extremely elastic, consisting of annular fibres,
so as to admit their being stretched to an extraordinary
length. Reaumur found that these animals could extend
their tails to near <i>twelve</i> times their own length.
The mechanism by which the terminal piece is pushed
forth or retracted, is very curious, though extremely
simple. Two large parallel <i>tracheæ</i>, the direction of
which is from the head<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> of the grub to its tail, occupy a
considerable portion of its interior: near the origin of
the tail, where they are very ample, they suddenly grow
very small, so as to form a pair of very slender tubes,
but so long that, in order to find room in a very contracted
space, they form numerous zigzag folds attached
to the terminal tube; when this issues from the outer
tube they consequently begin to unfold, and when it is
intirely disengaged, they are become quite straight and
parallel to each other. Reaumur has figured them as
being united at the <i>base</i> of the inner tube<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>; most probably,
however, they do not here stop short, but, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
other instances, proceed to the end, and terminate in
the two spiracles mentioned above: he conjectures that
when the animal has occasion to push forth its respiratory
apparatus, it injects into these vessels part of the air
contained in the body of the <i>tracheæ</i>, which of course
would cause them to unfold and push forth the tube<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>.
When this insect assumes the pupa, instead of its anal
respiratory organ it has <i>four</i> respiratory horns in the
trunk near the head<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.</p>

<p>The larva of the chamæleon-fly (<i>Stratyomis Chamæleon</i>)
is furnished with a respiratory organ of a still different
and more elegant structure, exhibiting some resemblance
to the <i>tentacula</i> of what are called sea anemones.
In this larva the last joint of the body is extremely
long, and terminates in an orifice to receive the
air, which is surrounded by a circle of about thirty diverging
rays, consisting of beautifully feathered hairs or
plumes<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. This apparatus serves the same purpose with
that above described of the larva of the gnat. The feathery
hairs are so prepared as to repel the water, and
thus to suspend the animal by its tail at the surface, and
preserve a constant access of air. When it has occasion
to sink, it turns these hairs in and shuts the orifice,
carrying down with it an air-bubble that shines like
quicksilver, and which Swammerdam conjectures enables
it again to become buoyant when it wants to breathe<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.</p>

<p>In the red aquatic larva of a small gnat (<i>Chironomus
plumosus</i>) there are <i>two</i> anal respiratory subcylindrical
horns, with the orifice fringed with hairs<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>; and in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
gnat Reaumur discovered <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. The larva of
<i>Tanypus maculatus</i>, whose remarkable <i>legs</i> I formerly
noticed<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>, exhibits in the <i>interior</i> of its trunk two long,
oval, opaque bodies, which De Geer conjectures may be
air-reservoirs; these, when the animal assumes the pupa,
according to every appearance become <i>external</i>, and are
placed on the back, precisely where the respiratory
horns of aquatic pupæ are usually situated,&mdash;they appear
to terminate in a transparent point<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. The pupa of a
<i>Tipula</i> observed by Reaumur, instead of <i>two</i> has only
<i>one</i> of these respiratory organs, in the form of a very
fine hair proceeding from the anterior end of the trunk,
and considerably longer than the animal itself<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.</p>

<p>It is observable that aquatic insects that come to the
surface of the water for air, receive it at the anus, often
carrying it down with them as a brilliant bubble of quicksilver.
This is generally done by means of spiracles in
perfect insects, but in the water-scorpion tribe in that
state respiration is by means of a long hollow tube, consisting
of two concavo-convex pieces which apply exactly
to each other. This is found in both sexes, and therefore
cannot be an <i>ovipositor</i>, as some have thought<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>These respiratory organs, however, are not invariably
confined to <i>aquatic</i> larvæ and pupæ, for those of some
aphidivorous flies have anal ones, and the pupa of <i>Dolichopus
nobilitatus</i>, or a fly nearly related to it, which is
<i>terrestrial</i>, has likewise a pair of long sigmoidal ones on
the back of the trunk<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. The pupa also of the rat-tailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
larva just noticed as having <i>four</i> horns, resides under
the <i>earth</i>, the insect being only <i>aquatic</i> in its grub state.</p>

<p>2. I am next to consider those respiratory appendages
by which aquatic insects, since they do not come to the
surface for that purpose, appear to extract air for respiration
from the <i>water</i>; so that they may be looked upon
in some degree as analogous to the <i>gills</i> of fishes: there
is, however, this difference between them&mdash;in fishes, the
blood is conveyed in minute ramifications of the arteries
to the surface of the branchial laminæ, through the membranes
of which they abstract the air combined with the
water; but as insects have no circulation, the process in
them must be different, and their branchiform appendages
may be regarded as presenting some <i>analogy</i>
rather than any <i>affinity</i> to those of fishes. The first approach
to this structure is exhibited by the pupa of a
gnat lately mentioned (<i>Chironomus plumosus</i>); for on each
side of the trunk this animal has a pencil consisting of
five hairs elegantly feathered, which, when they diverge,
form a beautiful star; its anus also is furnished with a
fan-shaped pencil of diverging hairs<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.</p>

<p>On most of the abdominal segments of the larvæ and
pupæ of the <i>Trichoptera</i> are a number of white membranous
floating threads, arranged in bundles, <i>four</i> on
each segment, two above and two below, and traversed
longitudinally by several air-vessels or <i>bronchiæ</i>, which
run in a serpentine direction, growing more slender as
they approach the extremity, and in some places sending
forth very fine ramifications,&mdash;these are their respiratory
organs<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>. The caterpillar also of a little aquatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
moth (<i>Hydrocampa stratiotata</i>) at first sight appears to
be covered on each side with hairs, but which examined
under a microscope are found to be branching flattish filaments,
each furnished with tubes from the <i>tracheæ</i>. These
caterpillars have also the semblance of spiracles, but apparently
found in the usual situation<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. The larva of a
little beetle often mentioned in my letters (<i>Gyrinus Natator</i>),
is furnished on each side of every abdominal segment
with a long, hairy, slender, acute, conical process,
of the substance of the segment, through each of which
an air-tube meanders; the last segment but one has
<i>four</i> of these processes, longer than the rest<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Laminose</i> or foliaceous respiratory appendages distinguish
the sides of the abdomen of the larvæ and pupæ of
the <i>Ephemeræ</i>, whose history you found so interesting<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>.
In them these organs wear much the appearance of <i>gills</i>.
In the different species they vary both in their number
and structure. With regard to their number, some have
only <i>six</i> pair of them, while others have <i>seven</i>. In their
<i>structure</i> the variations are more numerous, and sometimes
present to the admiring physiologist very beautiful
forms<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>. They usually consist of two branches, but occasionally
are single, with one part folding over the other,
as in one figured by Reaumur, which precisely resembles
the leaf of some plant, the air-vessels or <i>bronchiæ</i> in connexion
with the <i>tracheæ</i> branching and traversing it in
all directions, like the veins of leaves<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>. The double ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
differ in form. In the larva and pupa of <i>Ephemera vulgata</i>
there are <i>six</i> of these double false gills on each side
of the abdomen, the three last segments being without
them; each branch consists of a long fusiform piece, rather
tumid and terminating in a point, which is fringed
on each side with a number of flattish filaments, blunt
at the end. An air-vessel from the <i>trachea</i> enters the
gill at its base; is first divided into two larger branches,
each of which enters a branch of the false gill. These
branches send forth on each side numerous lesser ramifications,
one of which enters each of the filaments<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>. In
another species (<i>E. vespertina</i>) each false gill presents
the appearance of a pair of ovate leaves with a long
acumen, and the air-vessels represent the midrib of the
leaf, with veins branching from it on each side<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>; and, to
name no more, in <i>E. fusco-grisea</i>, one branch represents
the leaf of a <i>Begonia</i>, the sides not being symmetrical,
with its veins, while the other consists only of numerous
branching filaments<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>. In other aquatic larvæ, as in that
of the common May-fly (<i>Sialis lutaria</i>), these appendages
consist of several joints<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>.</p>

<p>By the above apparatus these aquatic animals are enabled
to separate the air from the water, as the fish by
their gills; but how this separation is made has not been
precisely explained. The false gills in many species are
kept in continual and intense agitation. When they
move briskly to one side, Reaumur conjectures they may
receive the air, and when they return back they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
emit it<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. This brisk motion probably disengages it from
the water. In many species, when in repose, they are
laid upon the back of the animal<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>, but in others they are
not<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.</p>

<p>The larvæ of the <i>Agrionidæ</i> appear to respire like
those of the <i>Ephemeræ</i>, &amp;c. by means of long foliaceous
laminæ or false gills filled with air-vessels; but instead
of being <i>ventral</i>, they proceed from the <i>anus</i>. They are
three in number, one dorsal and two lateral, perpendicular
to the horizon, of a lanceolate shape, beautifully
veined, with a longitudinal middle nervure, from which
others diverge towards the margin, which are probably
<i>bronchiæ</i>. They are used by the animal, which swims
like a fish, as fins, but it does not appear to imbibe the
water like the other <i>Libellulinæ</i>, nor to propel itself by
ejecting it,&mdash;a circumstance which furnishes an additional
argument for the more received opinion, that this action
in them is for the purpose of respiration as much as for
motion<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<p>The larvæ and pupæ of the <i>Libellulinæ</i>, receive the
water and air that they respire by a large anal aperture,
which is closed at the will of the animal by five hard,
moveable, triangular, concavo-convex pieces, all very
acute and fringed with hairs. These pieces are placed
so that there is one above, which is the largest of all;
one on each side, which are the smallest, and two below;
when these are closed they form together a conical point<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>.
Sometimes only three of these pieces are conspicuous<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
three other cartilaginous pieces, resembling the valves
of a bivalve shell, close the passage within the pointed
pieces<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. At this orifice the water is received; and
when, by an internal process to be described afterwards,
it has parted with its oxygen, is again expelled.</p>

<p>Under this head I shall mention a fact which may be
connected with respiration of the insects concerned. In
dissecting a moth related to <i>Catocala Pronuba</i>, but I
do not recollect the particular species,&mdash;at the base of
the abdomen of the male I discovered two bunches of
long fawn-coloured parallel hairs, planted each in an
oval plate, plane above, but below convex and fleshy;
while the plates remained attached to the insect, they
appeared to have a distinct pulsation. The hairs, which
are about half an inch long, diverge a little, and form a
tuft not very unlike a shaving-brush<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. I have not since
met with this species, but I have preserved the brush
and scale. Somewhere in Bonnet's works, but I do not
recollect where, I have since found mention of a similar
fact in another moth.</p>


<p>II. Having considered the <i>external</i> respiratory organs
of insects, by which the air is <i>received</i>, we are next to
consider the <i>internal</i> ones, by which it is <i>distributed</i>.
These are <i>gills</i>; <i>tracheæ</i> and <i>bronchiæ</i>; and <i>sacs</i> or
<i>pouches</i><a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.</p>

<p>i. Gills (<i>Branchiæ</i><a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>). Having lately described what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
may be denominated <i>false</i> gills, or branchiform appendages,
I shall now call your attention to what may be
denominated <i>true</i> ones, which are peculiar to the <i>Arachnida</i>
Class: but what is remarkable, the animals that
breathe by them are very rarely inhabitants of the water,
so that their functions cannot be perfectly analogous to
those of fishes.</p>

<p>In the <i>Scorpion</i>, on each side of the four first ventral
segments a spiracle may be discovered, which has no
<i>lip</i> as in other insects, but is merely a circular <i>orifice</i>.
These orifices do not lead to <i>tracheæ</i> or <i>vesicles</i>, but to
<i>true gills</i>, which are situated below a muscular web which
clothes the internal surface of the crust. Each gill consists
of many semicircular very thin plates, of a dead
milky white, which are connected together at the dorsal
end like the leaves of a book. There appear to be more
than <i>twenty</i> of these leaves, which when strongly magnified
look transparent and destitute of any vessels.
Each gill is fastened at the back to the spiracle<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. In the
<i>spiders</i> also, gills are discoverable, but differently circumstanced.
On the under side of the abdomen, near
the base, is a transverse depression, on each side of which
is a longitudinal opening leading to a cavity, which is
covered from above by a cartilaginous plate. In this
cavity is situated a true gill, which is white, triangular,
and covered with a fine skin; the leaves of this gill are
far more numerous and much finer and softer than those
of the gills of the scorpion. On account of their softness
they have often the appearance of a slimy skin; but their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
laminated structure shows itself very clearly in old specimens,
and in such as have been immersed in boiling
water<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Tracheæ</i> and <i>Bronchiæ</i><a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>. Parallel with each side
of the body of most <i>insects</i> and extending its whole
length, run <i>two</i> cylindrical tubes<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>, which communicate
with the spiracles<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>, and from which issue, at points opposite
to those organs, other tubes which ramify <i>ad infinitum</i>,
and are distributed to every part of the body<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>.
The first of these tubes are called the <i>tracheæ</i> and the
latter the <i>bronchiæ</i>. This structure appears, however,
not to be universal: it is to be found in caterpillars and
many <i>Dipterous</i> larvæ; but in that of the rhinoceros-beetle
and other Lamellicorns, the <i>bronchiæ</i> branch <i>directly</i>
from the spiracle, the bottom or interior mouth
of which is lined by a membrane from which they proceed<a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>:
something similar has been observed to take
place in many insects in other states, as the common
cockchafer<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>; in the pupa of <i>Smerinthus Populi</i><a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>; in the
<i>Cicadæ</i><a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>; in the Locust tribe<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>; and many others. In
the <i>Cossus</i>, or larva of the great goat-moth, the <i>trachea</i>
commences with the first spiracle, and finishes a little
beyond the last, after which it diminishes considerably
in diameter, and terminates in several branches or <i>bronchiæ</i>,
which proceed to the anal extremity of the body<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.
The <i>bronchiæ</i> which originate from the <i>tracheæ</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
vicinity of each spiracle, may be considered as consisting
in general of <i>three</i> packets;&mdash;<i>dorsal</i> ones, which are
distributed to the back and sides of the animal; <i>visceral</i>
ones, which enter the cavity of the body, and are lost
amongst the viscera and the caul; and <i>ventral</i> ones,
which dipping from the <i>tracheæ</i> overrun the lower part
of the sides and belly<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>tracheæ</i> and <i>bronchiæ</i> consist of <i>three</i> tunics<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>: the
<i>first</i> or external one is a thickish membrane, strengthened
by a vast number of fibres or vessels, which form
round it a number of irregular circles; the <i>second</i> is a
membrane more thin and transparent, without a vascular
covering<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>; the <i>third</i> is formed of a cartilaginous
thread running in a spiral direction, which may be easily
unwound<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. This structure gives a great elasticity to
these organs, so that they are capable of considerable
tension, after which they return to their usual length<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>.
The <i>Bronchiæ</i> are cylindrical or slightly conical, insensibly
diminishing in size as they leave the trunk, in which
they originate. In larvæ, after losing their spiral fibre,
they appear to terminate in membrane, but in perfect
insects they pass into vesicles<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. In the <i>Cossus</i> the <i>trachea</i>
is flattened, and in every segment, except the first and
two last, is bound by a fleshy cord four or five times as
thick as its threads. Where this occurs, there is a slight
constriction,&mdash;probably here is a sphincter, by the contraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of which Lyonet supposes the <i>trachea</i> may be
shut when it is necessary to stop the passage of the air,
and direct it to any particular point<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>. The structure
here described is admirably adapted for the purpose it is
intended to serve; for had these vessels been composed
of <i>membrane</i>, they could not possibly have been prevented
from collapsing; but by the intervention of a spiral
cartilaginous thread this accident is effectually guarded
against, and the necessary tension of the tubes provided
for. However violent the contortions of the insect, however
small the diameter of these vessels, they are sure to
remain constantly open, and pervious to the air. And
by this circumstance they may be always distinguished
from the other organs of the animal, and likewise by
their pearly or silvery hue, for from being constantly
filled with air, these tubes, when viewed under a powerful
microscope in a recently dissected insect, present a
most beautiful and brilliant appearance, resembling a
branching tree of highly polished silver or pearl:&mdash;though
sometimes they are blue, or of a lead colour, and
sometimes assume a tint of gold. In the dead insect
the larger tubes soon turn brown, but the finer ones preserve
their lustre several weeks<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. The ramifications of
the tracheal tree may be seen without dissection through
the transparent skin of the common louse<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and most of
the thin skinned larvæ.</p>

<p>You will not expect to view in this way the minuter
ramifications of the <i>bronchiæ</i>, when I have mentioned
their number and incredible smallness. Nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the scalpel of a Lyonet and the most powerful lenses
are adequate to trace the extremities of these vessels;
and even with every help, they at last become so inconceivably
slender as to elude the most piercing sight.
That illustrious anatomist found that the two <i>tracheæ</i> of
the larva of the <i>Cossus</i> gave birth to 236 bronchial tubes,
and that these ramify into no less than 1336 smaller tubes,
to which, if 232, the number of the detached bronchiæ,
be added, the whole will amount to 1804 branches<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>.
Surprising as this number may appear, it is not greater
than we may readily conceive to be necessary for communicating
with so many different parts. For, like the
arterial and venous trees, which convey and return the
blood to and from every part of the body in vertebrate
animals, the <i>bronchiæ</i> are not only carried along the intestines
and spinal marrow, each ganglion of which they
penetrate and fill, but they are distributed also to the
skin and every organ of the body, entering and traversing
the legs and wings, the eyes, antennæ, and palpi, and
accompanying the most minute nerves through their
whole course<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. How essential to the existence of the
animal must the element be that is thus anxiously conveyed
by a thousand channels, so exquisitely formed, to
every minute part and portion of it! Upon considering
this wonderful apparatus we may well exclaim, <i>This hath
<span class="smcap">God</span> wrought, and this is the work of his hands</i>.</p>

<p>Though in general there is only a <i>pair</i> of <i>tracheæ</i>, yet
in some larvæ a larger number have been discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
In those of the <i>Libellulinæ</i> there are <i>six</i>. According to
M. Cuvier, Reaumur, who mentions only <i>four</i>, overlooked
the two lateral ones that are connected with the spiracles<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>.
The reason of this and other parts of their internal
structure I shall explain under the next head. In
the grub of the gad-flies of the horse (<i>Gasterophili</i>,)
Mr. B. Clark discovered <i>eight</i> longitudinal <i>tracheæ</i>,&mdash;<i>six</i>
arranged in a circle and <i>two</i> minute ones, which appeared
to him to terminate in a pair of external nipples (spiracles)
in the neck of the animal<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>. This is a singular anomaly,
as the other <i>&#338;stridæ</i> have only a <i>pair</i> of <i>tracheæ</i><a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Respiratory Sacs or Pouches.</i> Besides their <i>tracheæ</i>
and <i>bronchiæ</i>, many insects are furnished with reservoirs
for the air, under the form of sacs, pouches, or vesicles.
These are commonly formed by the bronchial tubes
being dilated at intervals, especially in the abdomen, into
oblong inflated vesicles; from which other bronchial
tubes diverge, and again at intervals expand into smaller
vesicles, so as to exhibit no unapt resemblance&mdash;as Swammerdam
has observed with respect to those of the rhinoceros-beetle&mdash;to
a specimen of <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>. Cuvier
compares them in the Lamellicorn beetles in general to
a tree very thickly laden with leaves<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>; and Chabrier
observes that they particularly occur in the intestinal
canal<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>. This structure of the pulmonary organs may
be seen also in the common hive-bee, and other <i>Hymenoptera</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
but the vesicles are less numerous, and those at
the base of the abdomen much larger than the rest<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.
These vesicles, by a very rough dissection, may be distinctly
seen in the abdomen of the cockchafer, which
appears to be almost filled with them. Not being composed
of cartilaginous rings like the air-tubes, but of
mere membrane, if a pin pierces one, the air that inflates
it escapes, and it collapses. In the larva of a little gnat
(<i>Corethra culiciformis</i>) the <i>tracheæ</i> appear to proceed
from a pair of oblong vesicles of considerable size<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> in
the trunk, and towards the anus they form two other
smaller ones<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>,&mdash;upon piercing the former, De Geer observed
a considerable quantity of air to make its escape<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>.
Another species, probably of the same genus, described
by Reaumur, exhibits something similar<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>.</p>

<p>But one of the most remarkable structures, in this respect,
is to be seen in the larva and pupa of the dragon-flies
(<i>Libellulina</i>). I have before noticed the <i>number</i> of
their <i>tracheæ</i>, but I shall here describe their whole internal
respiratory apparatus. I must observe that <i>Reaumur</i>,
<i>Cuvier</i>, and most modern writers on the physiological
department of Entomology, have affirmed that they
respire the <i>water</i>, and that they receive it for that purpose
at their anal extremity: but M. Sprengel, from
having observed in the larvæ abdominal spiracles, is unwilling
to admit this as a fact<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>; and De Geer also seems
to hesitate upon it, especially as he discovered that the
animal seemed to absorb the water to aid it in its <i>motions</i><a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
But when we consider that it is by the action of a <i>pneumatic</i>
apparatus that the absorption and expulsion of the
water takes place, and that the animal when it has been
taken out of that element, upon being restored to it,
immediately has <i>eager</i> recourse to this action<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>, we shall
feel inclined rather to adopt the opinion of those great
physiologists Reaumur, Lyonet, and Cuvier, and admit
that it absorbs water for the purpose of <i>respiration</i>. I
shall now explain how this takes place. The pieces
both internal and external that close the anal orifice
have been before described; the others employed in the
admission and expulsion of the water are evidently <i>respiratory</i>
organs. When this orifice is opened, the parts
that are above it are drawn back in an opposite direction,
so that the five last segments of the abdomen become
entirely empty, and form a chamber to receive the water
that enters by it. When the water is to be expelled,
the whole mass of air-vessels which had receded towards
the trunk, is pushed forwards, and forms a piston that
again expels the water in a jet. It consists of an infinite
number of <i>bronchiæ</i>, entangled with each other, which
proceed from the middle and posterior end of the <i>tracheæ</i>.
M. Cuvier in the interior of the <i>rectum</i> of the larva discovered
twelve longitudinal rows of little black spots, in
pairs, which exhibited the resemblance of six pinnated
leaves. These are minute conical tubes, of the spiral
structure of <i>tracheæ</i>, which decompose the water, and
absorb the air contained in it. He also discovered that
each of these tubes gave birth to another outside the
<i>rectum</i>, which connected itself with one of the six great
longitudinal <i>tracheæ</i>; two of which are of enormous size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and appear to serve as reservoirs, since they furnish air
by transverse branches to two other tubes; they have
each a recurrent branch, which follows the course of the
intestinal canal, and furnishes it with an infinity of <i>bronchiæ</i><a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.
These <i>tracheæ</i> are found in the perfect insect.
The principal ones in some send forth many branches,
terminating in vesicles, which in shape resemble the seed-vessels
of some species of <i>Thlaspi</i>, while others appear
to form a file of oblong ones<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>. Near each of their spiracles
also is a vesicle which appears to be a reservoir<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>.</p>

<p>But this kind of structure is not confined to insects
strictly <i>aquatic</i>. Even such species of <i>terrestrial</i> ones as
live upon aquatic plants, and are, consequently, necessarily
or accidentally often a considerable time under
water, are furnished with some apparatus by means of
which they can exist in this element for a considerable
period. For example, most of the Weevils (<i>Rhyncophora</i>)
die in a short time if immersed in water; yet the species
of the genera <i>Tanysphyrus</i>, <i>Bagous</i>, and <i>Ceutorhynchus</i>
which feed on aquatic plants, can exist for days under
water, as I have ascertained by experiment. <i>C. leucogaster</i>
and another of the same tribe, swims like a <i>Hydrophilus</i>,
and will live a long time in a bottle filled with
water and corked tight. Other insects also, that are not
at all aquatic, have pneumatic pouches. A striated or
channeled vesicle I have found under the lateral angles
of the <i>collar</i> in the humble-bee, where Chabrier supposes
the vocal spiracles are situate; and also at the mouth of
the spiracles of the <i>metathorax</i> in <i>Vespa</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> In <i>Sphinx</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<i>Ligustri</i> the <i>bronchiæ</i> terminate in oblong vesiculoso-cellular
bodies, almost like lungs<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>; in <i>Smerinthus Tiliæ</i>
these are preceded by a simple vesicle bound with spiral
fibres<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>. M. Chabrier thinks that these air-bladders of
insects, amongst other functions, give more fixity and
force to the muscles for flight<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.</p>

<p>Many physiologists have seen an analogy between the
<i>spiral</i> vessels of <i>plants</i> and the <i>tracheæ</i> of <i>insects</i>; and
some of great name, as Comparetti, Decandolle, and
Kieser, have thought that in some instances they terminated
in the <i>oscula</i> or cortical pores: but Sprengel contends
that they are not accurate in this opinion<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>. In
fact, the principal analogy seems to be in the <i>spiral</i>
structure of both these vessels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having considered the different organs of respiration
both external and internal, I shall make a few further
observations upon this function. We know little more
respecting the mode in which insects <i>respire</i>, except that
they breathe out the air by the same kind of organs by
which they receive it,&mdash;namely, the <i>spiracles</i>, or their representatives.
This has been satisfactorily proved by
Bonnet, who showed that the experiments by which
Reaumur thought it established that insects inspire by
their spiracles, but expire through the mouth, anus, or
pores of the skin, are founded on an erroneous assumption.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
This physiologist, having observed on the surface
of submerged insects numerous bubbles of air, concluded
that they had passed through the above orifices<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>: but
Bonnet found by various experiments carefully conducted,
that this appearance was caused by air which adhered
to the skin and its hairs, and that when the access
of this was precluded by carefully moistening the skin
with water previously to immersion, this accumulation
of air-bubbles on its surface did not take place<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>. And
in a variety of instances he observed large ones issue
from all the spiracles, especially the anterior ones. These
bubbles sometimes were alternately emitted and absorbed
without quitting the spiracle<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>, and at others were darted
with force to the surface of the water, where they appeared
to burst with noise<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>. This author is of opinion
that the <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> pair of these organs are of most importance
to respiration<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>. Reaumur subsequently owned
that Bonnet's arguments had shaken his opinion<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>; and
some observations of his own, with respect to the respiration
of the <i>bot</i> of the <i>ox</i>, go to prove that expiration
and inspiration are not by the <i>same</i> spiracles; for he found
that the air in this animal was <i>expired</i> by the eight little
<i>lower</i> orifices before mentioned<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>, from which he clearly
saw the air-bubbles issue&mdash;the <i>upper</i> one he conjectures
receives the air<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>. As the only communication that this
grub has with the atmosphere is by its <i>posterior</i> extremity,
it follows, reasoning from analogy, that the anterior
respiratory plates of Dipterous larvæ, which may be
regarded as representing the spiracles of the trunk in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
insects in general, are destined for the escape of the air,
after it has parted with its oxygen, received by the anal
ones<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>. So that there seems very good ground for
M. Chabrier's opinion that <i>inspiration</i> is ordinarily by
the <i>abdominal</i> spiracles, and <i>expiration</i> by those of the
<i>trunk</i> of insects<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>. He seems to have been led to the
adoption of this opinion, not so much by experiments
similar to that of Reaumur just stated, but by observing
that in many instances these two sets of spiracles differ
from each other, the latter having a <i>convex</i> and the former
a <i>concave</i> mouth or bed<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. In some cases, however,&mdash;for
instance during flight,&mdash;he supposes the spiracles
of the trunk may <i>receive</i> as well as <i>emit</i> the air<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>: he likewise
is of opinion, and it seems not improbable, that by
means of these openings in the trunk, from the rush of
the superfluous air through them, insects produce those
sounds for which they are remarkable,&mdash;as the humming
of bees and flies. In the former he thinks the sound is
produced by the pneumatic apparatus covered by the
ends of the <i>collar</i>; while in the latter he attributes it to
the spiracles in the <i>metathorax</i> behind the wings attended
by a poiser<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>. I incline, however, to M. Dufour's opinion<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>,&mdash;that
the vocal spiracles in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, as
well as in the <i>Diptera</i>, are those <i>behind</i> the wings. Perhaps
both theories may be right; for if you take any
common humble-bee, you will find that, in the hand, it
produces one kind of sound when its wings are motionless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and another more complex and intense when they
vibrate. In numerous instances, however, there is no
very striking <i>external</i> difference between the spiracles of
the <i>trunk</i> and those of the <i>abdomen</i>: this observation
applies more particularly to the caterpillars of <i>Lepidoptera</i>;
but whether these receive the air by those of the
abdomen, and return it by those of the trunk, has not
yet been ascertained; and indeed, too little is at present
known upon the subject, and too few facts have been collected,
to admit of dogmatizing.</p>

<p>The <i>external signs</i> of respiration in insects are not universally
to be discovered. The alternate contraction and
expansion of the abdomen is, however, very visible in
some beetles, bees, the larger dragon-flies, and grasshoppers.
In one of the latter, <i>Acrida viridissima</i>, Vauquelin
observed that the inspirations were from fifty to
fifty-five times in a minute in atmospheric air, and from
sixty to sixty-five when in oxygen gas<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. But M. Chabrier
has given the most satisfactory account of these signs:
The abdomen, says he, is the principal organ of inspiration;
it can dilate and contract, lengthen and shorten,
elevate and depress itself. In flight, in elevating its extremity
at the same time with the wings, it contracts itself,
pushes the air into the trunk, and diminishes the
weight of the body by the centrifugal ascending force<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>.
In the majority of insects perhaps the dilatation of the
abdomen takes place by the recession of the segments
from each other by means of the elastic ligaments that
connect them; in others, as the <i>Dynastidæ</i>, <i>Galeodes</i>, &amp;c.
by the longitudinal folded membrane that unites the dorsal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and ventral segments&mdash;in the <i>Libellulina</i> by similar
<i>ventral</i> folds; and in <i>Cimbex</i> by membranous pieces in
the first dorsal segment, which De Geer observed was
elevated and depressed at the will of the animal<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>.</p>

<p>Air is as essential to insects in their <i>pupa</i> as in their
<i>larva</i> or <i>perfect</i> states. Lyonet, however, Musschenbroek,
Martinet, and some other physiologists, have
doubted whether <i>quiescent</i> pupæ breathed<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>; but Reaumur
and De Geer seem to have proved that they do<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>:
and if thrown into water, the same proof of respiration,
by the emission and retraction of a bubble of air takes
place, as in the larvæ; and De Geer found that if one
be transferred under water from one spiracle to another,
it will be absorbed by it<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>. Indeed, unless these pupæ
had breathed, where would have been the necessity for
the spiracles with which all are furnished? It is remarkable,
however, that all these spiracles do not seem of
equal importance in this respect. Reaumur found that
if the <i>posterior</i> spiracles only were closed with oil, the
insect suffered no injury; but that if the <i>anterior</i> ones
were similarly treated, it infallibly died<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. The respiration
however of pupæ seems more perfect in those that
have recently assumed that state, than in those that are
more advanced towards the imago; in which at first, from
Reaumur's experiments<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>, it appears that the posterior
spiracles were stopped; and in others still older, from
Musschenbroek's<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>, even the anterior ones. Those quiescent
pupæ that during that state remain <i>submerged</i>, respire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
air. De Geer has given an interesting record of
this, in the case of <i>Hydrocampa stratiotata</i>. This insect
spins a double cocoon, the outer one thin, and the inner
one of a close texture. In the pupa there are three pair
of conspicuous spiracles on the second, third, and fourth
segments of the abdomen, which are placed on cylindrical
tubes, and they appear to have no other air-vessels.
The respiratory gills of the larva having vanished, like
some others of the same genus, they know how to surround
themselves with an atmosphere of air in the midst
of the water, so that the interior of their inner cocoon is
impervious to the latter element&mdash;how they renew the
air has not been ascertained. Though they respire air,
water is equally necessary, for the animal died when kept
out of water<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

<p>The great majority of insects respire in much the same
manner in all their states, particularly as to their <i>external</i>
organs; for when the larva breathes by the lateral spiracles,
the pupa and imago usually do the same. The converse
of this, however, by no means holds; for it not unfrequently
happens that the two latter breathe by means
of lateral spiracles, though they received the air in their
larva state by an apparatus altogether different. Thus
the larvæ of many <i>Diptera</i> breathe by an anal tube, while
the pupa and imago follow the general system. Sometimes
a tribe of insects breathe by an apparatus quite
different in all their states, as we have seen to be the case
with the common gnat<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>, which has an <i>anal</i> respiratory
<i>tube</i> in its <i>first</i> state, <i>thoracic</i> respiratory <i>horns</i> in its <i>second</i>,
and the <i>ordinary</i> lateral <i>spiracles</i> in its <i>third</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Changes also take place in their <i>internal</i> organs. In
the larvæ the respiratory apparatus, especially the tracheal
tubes, is often much larger and more ramified than
in the imago; and as the former is the principal <i>feeding</i>
state, there seems good ground for Mr. B. Clark's opinion&mdash;that
the respiration is intimately connected with
the conversion of the food<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. In the <i>imago</i>, there appears
to be more provision for storing up the air in vesicular
reservoirs, than in the <i>larva</i>. Wonderful is the
mode in which some of the changes in the internal structure,
which these variations indicate, must necessarily
take place. They are, however, probably not more singular
than those which less obviously occur in the air-vessels
of all insects in their great change out of the larva
into the pupa state. But having before enlarged on this
subject, I need not repeat my observations<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>.</p>

<p>The access of air is as necessary to insects even in
their <i>egg</i> state<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>, and in many cases its presence seems
provided for with equal care, by means as beautiful as
those Sir H. Davy and Sir E. Home have shown to occur
in the oxygenation of the eggs and f&#339;tuses of vertebrate
animals<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>. It is only necessary to view the admirable
net-work of air-vessels which Swammerdam discovered
spread over the surface of the eggs of the hive-bee
while in the ovaries<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>,&mdash;a provision which, from analogy,
we may conclude obtains generally; from the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
which nature has attached to the oxygenation of
the germ while in the matrix. And judging from analogy,
we may infer that the access of this element is as
carefully secured after the egg is laid, as before. The
eggs of most insects being of a porous texture, often attached
to the leaves of plants, and some of them embedded
in the very substance of a leaf or twig<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>, are in a
situation for the abundant absorption of oxygen: and
the pouch of silk in which the eggs of spiders and <i>Hydrophili</i>
are deposited, may probably, from Count Rumford's
experiments, be of utility in the same point of view.
In the case of the <i>Trichoptera</i> and other insects<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> whose
eggs are dropped into the water enveloped in a mass of
jelly, this substance perhaps serves for aërating the included
embryo, in the same way with the jelly surrounding
the eggs of the frog, dog-fish, &amp;c. It would be
desirable to ascertain whether the former jelly be of the
same nature as the experiments of Mr. Brande have
shown the latter to be<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>. It is not improbable that the
singular rays that terminate the eggs of <i>Nepa</i><a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> may in
some way be connected with the aëration of the egg.</p>

<p>To what I have before remarked with regard to the
<i>vital heat</i> of insects<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>, I may under this head very properly
add a few further observations. I there stated, that
the temperature of these animals is usually that of the medium
they inhabit, but that bees, and perhaps other gregarious
ones, furnish an exception to this rule<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>. A confirmation
of this remark is afforded by Inch, a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
writer, who, upon putting a thermometer into a bee-hive
in winter, found it stand 27° higher than in the open air;
in an anthill, he found it 6° or 7° higher; in a vessel
containing many blister-beetles (<i>Cantharis vesicatoria</i>,)
4° or 5° higher. A thermometer, standing in the air at
14° R., put into a glass vessel with <i>Acrida viridissima</i>,
in nine minutes rose to 17°, and a similar result was observed
with respect to other insects<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>. Dr. Martine says
that caterpillars have but two degrees of heat above that
of the air they live in<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>. Coleopterous insects are said
to move slowly and with difficulty when the thermometer
sinks to 36°, to become torpid at 34°, and to lose muscular
irritability at a lower degree<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>. I have before observed
that some insects will bear to be frozen into an
icicle, and yet survive<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>: they share this power with
reptiles, fishes, and amphibia. But, however small the
excess of it in some insects above that of the medium
they inhabit, it proves that they possess the power of <i>generating</i>
heat. Whether, like the warm-blooded animals,
they generally possess that of <i>resisting</i> heat by perspiration,
&amp;c. is not so clear. Yet the heat to which some
can bear to be exposed, basking at noon, as Dr. Clarke
informs us<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>, on rocky and sandy places, exposed to the
full action of the sun, appears sufficient, if not resisted
by some principle of counteraction, to roast them to a
cinder. That bees perspire is well known, but probably
not singly.</p>

<p>When the respiration of insects is suspended by immersion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
in any fluid, it is often resumed, even when it
has been long and they are apparently dead, if they be
brought into contact with the atmosphere. Reaumur
found this to be the case with bees<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>; and Swammerdam
tells us that the maggot of the cheese-fly (<i>Tyrophaga Casei</i>)
lived six or seven days in rain-water<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>: he found it so
difficult to kill the larva of <i>Stratyomis Chamæleon</i>, which
he first immersed twenty-four hours in spirits of wine,
and then put them several days in water, without killing
them,&mdash;that he lost his patience, and dissected them
alive. He tried to drown them also in vinegar, in which
they held out more than two days<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>.</p>

<p>That the suspended animation and subsequent death
of most terrestrial insects when thrown into water is
caused by the want of <i>air</i>, is evident from this,&mdash;that the
same effect ensues if the spiracles be covered with any
oily or fatty matter. In this case too, their vital powers
soon become suspended: they revive, if the suffocating
matter be soon removed; and if this be not done, infallibly
perish. This fact was known to the ancients,
for Pliny observes that bees die if dipped in oil or honey<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>.
One exception to this law has been before mentioned<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>:
a similar contrivance secures the cheese-maggot
from having its respiration interrupted by its moist
and greasy food; the grub also of <i>Sarcophaga carnaria</i>,
and of other <i>Muscidæ</i> probably, has its posterior spiracles
placed in a plate at the bottom of a kind of fleshy
pouch, which has the shape of a hollow, truncated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
reversed cone. This pouch the grub can close whenever
it pleases, so as to cover its spiracles<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>. And numerous
other larvæ, both of <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Coleoptera</i>
that devour unclean and oily food, have doubtless some
protection of this kind for their spiracles and respiratory
plates.</p>

<h3><i>INTERNAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
OF INSECTS, CONTINUED.</i></h3>

<h5>CIRCULATION.</h5>


<p>We learn from the highest authority, that the <i>blood</i> is
the <i>life</i> of the animal<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>: every object of creation, therefore,
that is gifted with animal life, we may conclude, in
some sense, has blood, which in this large sense may be
defined&mdash;<i>The fluid that visits and nourishes every part
of a living body</i><a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>. But the <span class="smcap">Great Author</span> of nature
has varied the <i>machinery</i> by which this nutritive fluid is
formed and distributed, gradually proceeding from the
most <i>simple</i> to the most <i>complex</i> structure; in which he
seems to have seen it fit to <i>invert</i> the process observable
in the systems of sensation and respiration, where the
ascent is from the most <i>complex</i>, to the most <i>simple</i> structure.
In the lowest members of the animal creation,
the blood seems the portion they imbibe of the fluid medium
in which they reside, which when chylified, distributes
new molecules to all parts of their frame<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>. In
others, as in insects, it is formed by the chyle that transpires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
through the intestinal canal into the general cavity
of the body, where it receives oxygen from the air-vessels,
and is fitted for nutrition<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>. In these animals it is accompanied
by a long dorsal vessel, the first step towards
a <i>heart</i>, which alternately contracts and dilates with an
irregular systole and diastole, but appears to have no
vascular system connected with it, though in their preparatory
states it has an <i>extra-vascular</i> circulation which
ceases in the perfect insect. Again: in others, as the
<i>Tubicoles</i>, <i>Annelida</i>, &amp;c., a real <i>circulation</i> has been
discovered; that is to say, a system of veins and arteries,
but unaccompanied by a muscular heart<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. In the
<i>Arachnida</i> and <i>Branchiopod Crustacea</i> the long dorsal
vessel is also found; but in these it is connected with
an arterial and venous system, which receives, distributes,
and returns the blood<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>. It has therefore now
become a true <i>heart</i>, and there is a regular <i>circulation</i>;
and in the <i>Decapod Crustacea</i> the dorsal vessel is contracted
into an oval form, and placed nearly in the centre
of the trunk<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>. In the great majority of invertebrate animals
the blood is <i>white</i>, but in the <i>Annelida</i>, to which
Class the common dew-worm belongs, a curious anomaly
takes place&mdash;for it is <i>red</i><a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>. Thus a gradual ascent
is made to the circulating system of the vertebrate and
red-blooded animals. In all, however, the <i>blood</i> is the
principal instrument of nutrition and accretion; and is
on that account properly so denominated, though not
connected with a circulating system.</p>

<p>Having given you this general outline of the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
by which the blood is distributed in the different Classes
of animals, I shall now confine myself to the case of insects
and <i>Arachnida</i>, beginning with the <i>former</i>.</p>

<p>I. If you examine attentively the back of any smooth
caterpillar with a transparent skin, you will perceive in
that part an evident pulsation, as though a fluid were
pushed at regular intervals towards the head, along a
narrow tube which seems to run the whole length of the
body. Accurate dissections have proved that this appearance
is real, that there is actually present in the
back of most insects, placed immediately under the skin
and furnished with numerous air-vessels, a longitudinal
vessel<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> originating in the head near the mouth<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>, running
parallel with the alimentary canal nearly to the anus,
containing a fluid which is propelled in regular pulsations
of from 20 to 100 per minute, more or less as the
weather is colder or warmer<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>, causing a sensible alternate
systole and diastole from the anal extremity towards
the head. In the <i>Cossus</i> these pulses were observed
by Lyonet to begin in the <i>eleventh</i> segment, from
which they passed from segment to segment, till they
arrived at the <i>fourth</i>, where they terminated<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>. This
vessel is what Malpighi, who first discovered it, termed
a <i>heart</i>, or rather series of hearts<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>; but which Reaumur,
who injected it, regarded as a simple <i>artery</i> without
striking contractions<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>: but to steer clear of any hypothesis,
I shall merely call it the <i>dorsal vessel</i> (<i>Pseudo-cardia</i>).
When carefully taken out of the body it is
found to be a membranous tube, appearing to be closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
at each end<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>, in many larvæ of equal diameter every
where, but in perfect insects usually widest at the <i>anal</i>
extremity<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>, and attenuated into a very slender filament
towards the head. In some insects, however, as in the
larva of the chamæleon-fly (<i>Stratyomis Chamæleon</i>), it is
attenuated at <i>both</i> ends, and in the <i>Ephemera</i> is alternately
constricted and dilated as Malpighi describes that
of the silkworm<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>, a dilated portion belonging to each
segment<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. In the <i>Cossus</i>, and probably others, after the
<i>third</i> segment, it is furnished with nine pair, the three
posterior pair being the largest, of triangular transverse
bundles of muscular fibres, which Lyonet denominates
its <i>wings</i><a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>, the action of which produces its systole and
diastole, and their propagation from the tail towards the
head<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>. Under the last pair of these wings it is strengthened
by a large number of circular muscular fibres<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>.
I have stated it as <i>appearing</i> to be closed at each extremity,
because Cuvier and most writers have so regarded
it, and probably it is so closed in the perfect insect;
but from Lyonet's words it should seem that, in
the larva of the <i>Cossus</i>, he considered it as open and
expanded at its anterior end<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. He seems also to suspect,
that, by means of what he calls the frontal ganglions,
a fluid is derived from the dorsal vessel to the
spinal marrow. He likewise describes a large nerve as
passing through it and becoming recurrent<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>. Carus, as
we shall soon see, has also proved that this tube is not
closed in larvæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>fluid</i> which this vessel contains is very abundant;
in the animal it appears colourless and transparent like
water, but when collected in drops it becomes more or
less yellow, and even orange<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. Examined under the
microscope it appears filled with a prodigious number of
transparent globules, of incredible minuteness<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>. When
mixed with water, which it does readily, its globules lose
all their transparency, and coagulate into small clammy
masses. After evaporation it becomes hard, and cracks
like gum, as blood does also. This gummy substance is
so abundant, that the fluid contained in the dorsal vessel
of the caterpillar of the <i>Cossus</i> yields a mass of it of the
size of a grey pea<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>.</p>

<p>From the situation of this dorsal vessel, which is precisely
the same with that of the heart in <i>Arachnida</i> and
the Branchiopod <i>Crustacea</i>, and from the systole and
diastole which keep its fluid contents in constant motion,
who can wonder that the physiologists who first discovered
it, reasoning analogically, maintained that it was a
true <i>heart</i>? But modern comparative anatomists, and
those of the highest name, from the absence of a vascular
system for a circulation, have contended that it is
not a true heart, but an organ appropriated to other
purposes: a third hypothesis, and intermediate between
these two, has very recently been promulgated, that
the organ in question, namely, is a real heart, and in the
preparatory states of insects, the centre of a real circulation,
which, in the imago state, ceases with the full development
of the wings; but that this circulation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<i>extravascular</i>, or without peculiar vessels analogous to veins
and arteries.</p>

<p>I shall now enlarge a little upon each of these hypotheses,
beginning with the first or original one.</p>

<p>No one will deny that the argument from analogy is
strongly in favour of this: I need not therefore dwell
upon it, but proceed to others. Swammerdam, to whose
exactness in observing, and scrupulous accuracy, every
reader of his immortal work will bear testimony, expressly
asserts that he has seen vessels issuing from the
dorsal vessel in the silkworm, and even succeeded in
injecting them with a coloured fluid<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>. Now it seems
extremely improbable that so practised and expert an
anatomist should have been deceived, especially upon a
point which would naturally excite his most earnest and
undivided attention. Without this <i>recorded</i> experiment,
perhaps, it might be thought, though this was very unlikely,
that he had mistaken <i>bronchiæ</i> for veins and arteries:
but how could they have been <i>injected</i> from the
supposed heart? Another great physiologist, Reaumur,
in the caterpillar of the saw-fly of the rose (<i>Hylotoma
Rosæ</i>) observed, besides the <i>dorsal</i> vessel, a <i>ventral</i> one
of similar form, in which also was a pulsation, but slower
than that of the other. This he supposes may be the
principal trunk of the veins<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>. Bonnet thought he discovered
a similar vessel in a large caterpillar, but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
all his attention could perceive no motion in it<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. Reaumur
also fancied he perceived in the grub of <i>Musca
vomitoria</i>, in which he in vain looked for the dorsal vessel,
a fleshy part which exhibited alternate pulsations;
and when with a pair of scissors he made a lateral incision
in the insect, amongst other parts that came out,
there was one that had movements of contraction and
dilatation for several minutes,&mdash;this experiment was repeated
with the same result upon several grubs<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>. De
Geer, whose love of truth and accuracy no one will call
in question, saw the appearance of blood-vessels in the
leg of the larva of a <i>Phryganea</i> L. (as Lyonet did in
those of a flea<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>); and in the transparent thigh of <i>Ornithomia
avicularia</i> he discovered a pulse like that of an
artery<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>. Baker, whose only object was to record what
he <i>saw</i>, speaks of the <i>current</i> of the blood being remarkably
visible in the legs of some small <i>bugs</i><a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>: what he
meant by that term is uncertain, but they could not be
<i>spiders</i>, which he had just distinguished. This author
has likewise seen a green fluid passing through the vessels
of the wings of grasshoppers<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>; and M. Chabrier is
of opinion that insects possess the power of propelling a
fluid into the nervures of their wings and withdrawing it
at pleasure, as they are elevated or depressed<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>; but this
last fact may be independent of a circulation.</p>

<p>But though these arguments, which I have stated in
their full force, appear strong, and at first sight conclusive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
those which may be urged for the more modern opinion&mdash;that
no circulation exists in insects, properly so
called,&mdash;appear to have still greater weight. Lyonet,
whose piercing eye and skilful hand traced the course of
so many hundred nerves and <i>bronchiæ</i> long after they
became invisible to the unassisted eye, and which were
a thousand times smaller than the principal blood-vessels,
opening into so large an organ as the supposed heart of
insects, might be expected to be, could never discover
any thing like them. His most painful researches, and
repeated attempts to inject them with coloured liquors,
were unable to detect the most minute opening in the
dorsal vessel, or the slightest trace of any artery or vein
proceeding from or communicating with it<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>. And Cuvier,
whose unrivalled skill in Comparative Anatomy peculiarly
qualified him for the investigation, repeated these
inquiries, and tried all the known modes of injection,
with equal want of success; and is thus led to the conclusion,
that insects have no circulation, that their dorsal
vessel is no heart, and therefore ought not to be called
by that name: that it is rather a secretory vessel, like
many others of that kind in those animals. As to the
nature of the fluid that it secretes, and its use, he thinks
it impossible, from our present information on the subject,
to form any satisfactory conclusion<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>. Marcel de Serres
informs us&mdash;which further seems to prove that it can be
no real heart&mdash;that this vessel may be totally removed
without causing the immediate death of the insect<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>.
This opinion receives additional confirmation from the
mode in which <i>respiration</i> is performed in insects. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
those animals that have a circulation, this takes place by
means of <i>lungs</i> or <i>gills</i>;&mdash;thus we find, even in the <i>Crustacea</i>
and <i>Arachnida</i> so nearly related to insects, that
the organs of this function are true <i>gills</i>; whereas in insects,
though in some of their states their respiratory
tubes are branchiform, yet they are <i>not</i> gills, and the
respiration is by tubes and spiracles. And these tubes,
as you have seen, are so numerous and so infinitely ramified
and dispersed, as to occupy the place of arteries
and veins, and to imitate their distribution,&mdash;and thus
to oxygenate what may be deemed the real analogue of
the blood, which bathes every internal part of the body
of an insect. Those animals likewise that have a circulation
are furnished with a <i>liver</i>, as is the case with the
<i>Arachnida</i> and even many aggregate animals that have
a heart; but in insects there are only hepatic ducts.
M. Cuvier has also proved that the <i>conglomerate glands</i>,
which exist in all animals that have a heart and blood-vessels,
do not exist in insects, in which they are replaced
by long slender secretory tubes, which without being
united float in the interior of the body: from this circumstance,
he is led to conclude that their nutrition is by
<i>imbibition</i> or immediate absorption, as in the <i>Polypi</i> and
other zoophytes, the chyle transpiring through the alimentary
canal, and running uniformly to all parts of
the body<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>.</p>

<p>These arguments appear so satisfactory, that Physiologists
in general seem to have been convinced by them
that no circulation, at any time, takes place in insects,
and that their supposed heart is merely a secretory vessel,
though of what kind they were at a loss to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
conjecture<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>. But, convincing as they seem, they appear to
have been founded in <i>error</i>, and on the idea that a <i>circulation</i>,
as well as a <i>heart</i>, necessarily implies a <i>vascular</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<i>system</i> consisting of veins and arteries; for by the recent
discoveries of M. Carus, it has been satisfactorily proved
that insects in their preparatory states, have an <i>extravascular</i>
circulation, the arterial and venose currents not
being confined by <i>parietes</i>. The observations upon which
M. Carus' hypothesis is founded, were made in the Autumn
of 1826; and an abstract of their results presented
to the Union of German Naturalists and Physicians,
which then held its meeting at Dresden, many of the
members of which, as MM. Oken, Husche, Heyne,
Purkinje, Otto, Weber, and Müller, had ocular proofs
of the reality of the phenomena.</p>

<p>His first observations were made on the larva of <i>Agrion
Puella</i>, which swims by means of three vertical laminæ
attached to the tail; which, when the wings first appear
as rudiments, begin to be exsiccated and are finally detached.
Each of these laminæ, in its natural vertical
position, presents an inferior abdominal and a superior
dorsal edge, has two tracheæ running along its centre
with ramifying bronchiæ, and consists of granular substance
contained between two strata of the external integuments.
A current of blood-globules enters each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
lamina somewhat nearer to its abdominal than to its
dorsal edge, and running through the greater part of its
length suddenly turns and bends its course back towards
the body, somewhat nearer to the dorsal than to the abdominal
margin of the lamina. The channel thus formed
in the midst of the granular substance is perfectly transparent,
except where it is occupied by the blood-globules,
or crossed by the bronchiæ. The parietes of the channel
are not strictly defined, nor formed by any thing like
the coats of a vessel, the blood circulating through the
granular <i>Parenchyma</i>; a circumstance however which is
not peculiar to this case, but also occurs generally in the
first states of the circulation, as it presents itself for instance
in the embryo of <i>Fishes</i>, and in the <i>figura venosa</i>
of the incubated egg<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>. The blood-globules are elongated
like a grain of wheat, considerably larger than those of
the human blood, and float in a fluid which is invisible
because of its transparency, but the existence of which is
proved by the variations in the position of the globules
in the current, sometimes following its direction, at others
crossing it transversely, or more or less obliquely.</p>

<p>When the animal is vigorous, the current is uninterrupted,
although its velocity is accelerated at regular intervals;
and that not only in the excurrent (<i>arterial</i>), but
also in the recurrent (<i>venous</i>) part of its course through
the lamina. When the animal becomes exhausted, or the
laminæ exsiccated, the circulation is interrupted, and in
the same manner, as under the same circumstances, in
the larvæ of frogs and lizards; the disturbance displaying
itself not merely by a cessation of the process, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
by retrograde movements of the currents, or by oscillatory
motions of the blood-globules.</p>

<p>In proportion as the wings are developed, the circulation
in the laminæ diminishes, and ultimately ceases, preparatory
to the detachment of the laminæ themselves.
At the same time, however, it presents itself under a new
form in the wings. In these the excurrent or arterial
stream takes its course along the inner margin of the
wing, and the recurrent or venous returning along the
outer; whilst, occasionally, other transverse currents take
their course through the net-work of the wing from its
inner to its outer margin. As the wings are further
developed, the circulation in them, like that in the caudal
laminæ, gradually becomes weaker and ultimately
ceases<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>.</p>

<p>The next observations were made on the transparent
larva of a neuropterous insect (probably a <i>Semblis</i> or
<i>Sialis</i>), in which the pulsations of the dorsal vessel were
distinctly seen at its posterior extremity, from which they
were propagated towards the anterior; these two divisions
of that vessel appearing to bear to each other the relation
of a <i>heart</i> and <i>aorta</i>. There were no traces of other
vessels, though regular and rapid currents of blood-globules,
exterior to the tracheæ, proceeded from the head
towards the posterior extremity of the body, where each
of these currents entered the heart, which again propelled
its contents with accelerated velocity through the anterior
part of the dorsal vessel towards the head. The lateral
currents also were accelerated upon each contraction of
the heart, proving that they must communicate with the
dorsal vessel at the anterior part of the body, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
opacity of the head rendered it impossible to ascertain
the mode of <i>anastomosis</i>. An excurrent and returning
current were also traced to each of the legs<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>. But the
phenomena of the circulation was most distinctly visible in
the larva of <i>Ephemera vulgata</i>, even more distinctly than
it is possible to trace it in the larvæ of frogs and newts.
In this animal the circulation, with the help of the microscope,
is at once visible in the three last segments of the
body; and with a little attention is discoverable not only in
the three terminal <i>caudulæ</i>, and in the upper joints of the
legs, but also in the head, and particularly the roots of
the antennæ. In the posterior part of the body there
are on each side two currents of blood, not bounded by
parietes, situate on each side of the intestinal canal, the
inner one being the most considerable. The external
one communicates with the internal by several intermediate
branches; from this probably the streams are detached,
which in the form of loops are seen at the upper
joints of the legs, though it is not possible precisely to
ascertain this, nor even whether these lateral currents
continue distinct in the thorax, which probably they do.
At the ninth abdominal segment these currents which
flow posteriorly from the head, change their direction,
and are inflected so as to enter the pulsating heart, from
which the current again flows towards the head. Before
they enter the heart they give off three streams, one for
each of the three <i>caudulæ</i>. The currents in these <i>caudulæ</i>
present the phenomena of the circulation with peculiar
distinctness, and are particularly remarkable from the
circumstance, that the excurrent and recurrent streams,
though closely approximated without any visible separation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
flow without disturbing each other. The excurrent
stream is accelerated in correspondence with the
pulsations of the heart; the recurrent on the contrary
being always somewhat more sluggish, and the first to
stagnate and cease when the strength of the animal is
impaired. In the anterior part of the head currents
can be discovered, forming loops like those of the legs,
at the roots of the antennæ; each current proceeding
from the cranial surface, and in returning taking its
course towards the region of the larynx<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.</p>

<p>M. Carus has likewise observed currents of blood in
the larvæ of water-beetles (<i>Hydrophilus</i> and <i>Dytiscus</i>)<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>;
but at present he appears to have detected it in no terrestrial
larva. Whether this is occasioned by their opacity,
or it exists only in the ovum, as he seems to suspect<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>,
must be left for determination to future observers; it is
scarcely probable, however, that the larvæ of <i>Dytisci</i> and
<i>Hydrophili</i> should differ from other <i>Coleoptera</i> in their
circulation.</p>

<p>The endeavours of M. Carus to discover any proofs
of a circulation in insects in their last state, except in
the wings at their first development, were without success<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>.
He observes that the fact of the currents of
fluids in larvæ not being defined by vascular parietes,
enables us to comprehend the rapidity and facility with
which the traces of the circulation are lost in the perfect
insect. On the other hand, that the existence of a circulation
at one period, and its cessation at another, elucidate
many circumstances connected with the physiology
of these animals: for instance, the contrast between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
rapid growth and transformations of the larvæ, and the
stationary existence of the imago, &amp;c. Lastly he remarks,
that the phenomena of this circulation do not throw
any light on the obscure subject of the mode of nutrition
in perfect insects; which therefore must still be supposed
to be effected according to the idea of Cuvier, without
the intervention of vessels<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever be the functions of the dorsal vessel, this
seems the most proper place to state to you what further
is known respecting it. Its construction is nearly alike
in insects in all their states, except that in the imago it
is shorter and narrower. Reaumur has affirmed, and
before him Malpighi made a similar observation, that in
chrysalises newly disclosed from the larva, and yet transparent,
the motion of the included fluid is the reverse of
what it has been in that state, it being propelled from
the head to the tail, which he found to be the case also
in the imago<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>. If this be true, and there is no reason to
doubt his accuracy, when they are more advanced, it resumes
its old course, as Lyonet observed, from the tail
to the head<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>. But probably it is not always uniformly
in the same direction, since Malpighi states that a very
slight cause will change its course, and that the pulsations
differ in quickness in different portions of the heart<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>.
If its course were really always the same, and in one direction,
without any reflux, it would seem to follow that
the fluid must be absorbed at one end, and, if there was
no outlet, transpire at the other, which would be a kind
of circulation. In <i>Syrphus Pyrastri</i> and other aphidivorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
flies, this dorsal vessel, instead of the usual form
which it had in the larva, assumes a very peculiar appearance.
If, taking one of these flies by the head and
wings and holding it up to the light, you survey under a
lens the base of the lower part of its abdomen, you will
see through its transparent skin, which exactly forms
such a window as physicians have sometimes wished for
in order to view the interior of their patients, a flask-shaped
vessel having its long end directed towards the
trunk, in which there is a manifest pulsation and transmission
of some fluid. This vessel extends in length
from the junction of the trunk with the abdomen to
about the termination of the second segment. The included
fluid does not run in the dorsal vessel in a regular
course, but is propelled at intervals by drops, as if
from a syringe, first from the wide end towards the trunk,
and then in the contrary direction, forming a very interesting
and agreeable spectacle. One circumstance led
Reaumur to conjecture that the neck of this vessel, which
he at first regarded as simple, is in fact composed of two
or more approximated tubes, and that the blood is conveyed
forward by the outward ones, and backward by the
intermediate one<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>: he even thinks that he saw a kind
of secondary heart, at the extremity next the trunk, for
the purpose of causing the reflux. This illustrious author
observed the above remarkable structure not only
in the <i>Syrphi</i>, but in many of their affinities, and thinks
that it is also widely diffused amongst the <i>Muscidæ</i><a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>.</p>

<p>I must now say something upon what I conceive to be
the real <i>blood</i> of insects; for I think no one will object
to that name being given to their nutritive fluid, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
in the larva, though it does not circulate by means of a
vascular system. The chyle that is produced in the intestines
of animals from the food, is that fluid substance
from which their blood is formed: in insects it is not absorbed
by the lacteals, but transpires through the pores
of the intestinal canal into the general cavity of the body,
where, being exposed to the influence of the oxygen in
the air-vessels, it becomes, though retaining its colour,
a different fluid from what it was before, and analogous
to blood in its use and office<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>; only that in these animals,
as Cuvier has observed, at least in their perfect state, the
blood, for want of a circulating system, not being able
to seek the air, the air goes to seek the blood<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>. The
dispersion of this fluid appears to be universal, so that
all the parts and organs contain it in a greater or less
degree<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>. In many insects, if you break only an antenna
or a leg, a drop of fluid flows out at the wound. In larvæ,
the fluid which bathes<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>, or visits, all the internal parts and
organs is not only sufficient for their nutriment, but a
large quantity of seemingly superfluous blood remains that
is not wanted for this purpose. This is expended in
the production of the caul or <i>epiploon</i> (<i>Corps graisseux</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Reaum.), which laps over and defends all the viscera of
the animal, and goes principally to the formation of the
imago<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>. I have said that Cuvier conceives nutrition in
insects to take place by <i>imbibition</i> or immediate absorption;
that is, I suppose, the different parts and organs
thus constantly bathed in the blood, imbibe from it the
particles necessary for their constant accretion. M. Chabrier
seems to think that it is the compression and dilatation
of the trunk that duly distributes the nutritive
fluid<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>; Lyonet compares the nutrition of insects by
their fibres from this fluid, when formed into the <i>corps
graisseux</i>, to that of plants that draw their support by
their roots from the earth<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>. Much obscurity, however,
at present rests upon this subject&mdash;much for future
investigation to explore; but in all the works of the
<span class="smcap">Most High</span> there is always something inscrutable,
something beyond the reach of our senses and faculties,
which teaches us humbly to adore his infinite perfections.</p>

<p>II. The circulation of the <i>Arachnida</i> is next to be
considered; and the term applied to these becomes
strictly proper. Two great tribes, in our view of the
subject, constitute this Class,&mdash;the spiders (<i>Araneidea</i>)
and scorpions (<i>Scorpionidea</i>): I shall give you some account
of the circulating vessels of each.&mdash;In <i>spiders</i>, the
heart in general is a long dorsal vessel as in insects, but
supposed to be confined to the <i>abdomen</i>, growing slenderer
towards each extremity, particularly the anal. In
some also, as in <i>Aranea domestica</i>, like that of insects, it
has lateral muscular appendages; but in others, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<i>Clubiona atrox</i>, it is without them<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>. It exhibits a pair of
vessels that appear to connect with the gills, by which
the oxygenation of the blood takes place, and a number
of others that ramify minutely and are lost in the analogue
of the <i>epiploon</i>, supposed to be their <i>liver</i><a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>. Whether
these last are to be regarded merely as <i>veins</i>, has
not been ascertained; they seem rather to convey the
blood outwards, than to return it back to the heart: but
this question must be left for future investigation. I may
observe, however, that though the heart of the spider
has been traced only in the <i>abdomen</i>, it may probably extend
into the <i>trunk</i>.</p>

<p>The heart of the <i>scorpion</i> has been examined both by
Treviranus and Marcel de Serres; but I shall principally
confine myself to the description of the latter, as the
most clear and intelligible. The heart, then, of these
animals is elongated, almost cylindrical, but attenuated
at each end; it is extended from the head to the extremity
of the tail, and appears to have four pairs of lateral
muscles. On each side are four pairs of principal vessels,
which go to the pulmonary pouches, and there
ramify. These may be assimilated to <i>veins</i>. Besides
these, there are four other vessels that cross them, forming
with them an acute angle, and which, with four
branches of smaller size, receive the blood from the pulmonary
pouches, and distribute it to the different parts
of the body,&mdash;these are the <i>arteries</i>. Before it enters
the tail, the heart throws out two vascular branches
which do not go to the gills, but distributing the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to different parts, ought to be considered as arteries<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.
Treviranus mentions bunches of reticulated vessels, concerning
the use and origin of which he seems uncertain<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>;
but as they approach the gills they are probably the
branching extremities of what M. de Serres considers
as the veins.</p>

<h3><i>INTERNAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
OF INSECTS, CONTINUED.</i></h3>

<h5>DIGESTION.</h5>


<p>"The immense Class of insects," says the immortal
Cuvier, "in the structure of its alimentary canal exhibits
as many variations as those of all the vertebrate animals
together: there are not only the differences that strike
us in going from family to family and from species to
species; but one and the same individual has often a
canal quite different, according as we examine it in its
larva or imago state; and all these variations have relations
very exact, often easily estimable, with the temporary
or constant mode of life of the animals in which it
is observable. Thus the voracious larvæ of the <i>Scarabæi</i>
and butterflies have intestines ten times as large as
the winged and sober insects&mdash;if I may use such an expression&mdash;to
which they give birth<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>."</p>

<p>In the natural families of these creatures, the same
analogy takes place with respect to this part that is observable
in the rest of the Animal Kingdom; the length
and complication of the intestines are here, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
other Classes, often an index of a less substantial kind
of nutriment; while their shortness and slenderness indicate
that the insect lives by prey<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>.</p>

<p>In considering therefore the parts connected with the
digestive functions of the insect world, it will not be amiss
to have reference to their <i>food</i>, and their mode of taking
it; but first it will be proper to state and define the parts
of this important organ.</p>

<p>In general the alimentary canal<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> is composed of the
same essential <i>tunicks</i> as that of the vertebrate animals,
consisting of an interior epidermis, a papillary and cellular
tunick, and an exterior muscular one<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>. The first is
usually tender, smooth, and transparent; but not always
discoverable, perhaps on account of its tender substance<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>.
Ramdohr does not notice the papillary and
cellular tunicks; they are probably synonymous with
what he denominates&mdash;the <i>flocky layer</i> (<i>Die flockige lage</i>),
and which he describes, when highly magnified, as appearing
to consist of very minute globules or dark points,
and as being of a cellular structure<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. The <i>exterior</i> tunick
is thicker and stronger than the <i>interior</i>, and composed
of muscular fibres, running either longitudinally,
or transversely so as to form rings round the canal.
This tunick mostly begins at the mouth, and goes to the
anus, changing its conformation in different parts of the
above intestine. Sometimes however it originates only
at the beginning of the stomach<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>. With respect to its
general disposition, that canal&mdash;in its relative length, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the size of its different parts, in the number and form of
its dilatations, and particularly of its stomachs and its
c&#339;cums, and in the folds of its interior&mdash;exhibits variations
altogether analogous to those of vertebrate animals,
and which produce similar effects<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>. As to its <i>parts</i>, it
may be considered as consisting of <i>two</i> larger portions,
between which the biliary or hepatic vessels form the
point of separation. In the first, the most universal parts
are the gullet and the stomach; and in the second, the
small intestine and the large intestine<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>.</p>

<p>1. The <i>gullet</i> (<i>&#338;sophagus</i><a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>) is that portion of the intestinal
canal which, receiving the food from the pharynx,
or immediately from the mouth, conveys it to the stomach.
Though it often ends just behind the <i>head</i><a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>, it
is usually continued through the <i>trunk</i>, and sometimes
even extends into the middle of the <i>abdomen</i><a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>; it therefore
seldom much exceeds in length half the body. It
is constantly long when the head is connected with the
trunk by a narrow canal&mdash;as in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>,
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, &amp;c.; but is frequently short when
these parts are more intimately united<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>. It often ends
in a kind of sac analogous to the crop of birds. Under
this head I must mention a part discovered by
Ramdohr, which he calls the <i>food-bag</i> (<i>Speisesack</i>), as
he thinks, peculiar to <i>Diptera</i><a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>. From the mouth in
these proceeds a narrow tube into the abdomen, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
it expands into a blind sac having no connexion with
the stomach; so that the fluid food, as blood, &amp;c. stored
in it, must be regurgitated into the mouth before it can
pass into that organ<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>. Thus these animals, besides their
stomach, have a <i>reservoir</i> in which to store up their
food; the product therefore of a single meal will require
several days to digest it.</p>

<p>2. The <i>stomach</i> (<i>Ventriculus</i><a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>) is that part of the intestinal
canal immediately above the bile-vessels, which
receives the food from the gullet for digestion, and transmits
it when digested to the lower intestines<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>. By its
admixture with the gastric juice, the food acquires in
the stomach a quite different colour from what it had in
the gullet. In herbivorous <i>insects</i> it contains no acid,
but, like the gastric juice of herbivorous <i>quadrupeds</i>, is of
an alkaline nature<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>. The chyle is forced through this
organ, probably in part by the pressure of the muscular
fibres during the peristaltic motion; and being pressed
through the <i>inner</i> skin, is first collected in the intermediate
cellular part, and ultimately forced through the
<i>outer</i> skin<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>. At its posterior end it terminates in the
<i>pylorus</i>, a fleshy ring or sphincter formed of annular
muscular fibres<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>. The stomach often consists of two
or more successive divisions, which are separated from
each other, and are often of an entirely different conformation
and shape<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, Predaceous
<i>Coleoptera</i>, and several other insects, an organ of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
kind precedes the ordinary stomach, which from its
structure Cuvier denominates a second stomach or <i>gizzard</i><a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>;
Posselt improperly calls it <i>Cardia</i><a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>; and by
Ramdohr it is named the <i>plaited-stomach</i> (<i>Falten-magen</i><a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>).
It is a short fleshy part consisting of two skins,
placed above the opening of the stomach, and perhaps
rather belongs to the gullet. The <i>inner</i> skin is formed
into longitudinal folds, and sometimes armed with horns,
teeth, or bristles. Its cavity is very small and compressed,
so as to admit only small masses of food, and
yet present them to a wide surface for the action of the
teeth or bristles;&mdash;in this stomach therefore, as in the
gizzard of birds, to which it seems clearly analogous<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>,
the food is more effectually comminuted and rendered
fit for digestion. The muscles, by which its action
upon the food is supported, in some species amount to
many thousands<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>. Rudiments of a gizzard are sometimes
found concealed in the gullet of many insects<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.
The idea of Swammerdam, Cuvier, &amp;c. that grasshoppers
and other insects that have this kind of stomach,
chew the cud<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>, Ramdohr affirms is entirely erroneous<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.
Besides its divisions, the stomach has other <i>appendages</i>
that require notice. In most <i>Orthoptera</i>, a pair or more
of blind intestines or <i>c&#339;ca</i> may be found at the point of
union of the gizzard with the stomach<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>, which have been
regarded as forming a <i>third</i> stomach: they also begin
the stomach in the louse<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>; they form a coronet round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the apex of that organ, in the grub of the cockchafer<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>;
and in that of the rose-beetle, there is one at the apex, one
in the middle, and a third at the base<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. Besides these
appendages, which are formed of the skin of the stomach,
there are others that are not so. In the Predaceous and
some other beetles, the whole external surface of this
organ is covered with small blind appendages opening
into the space between its two skins, which cause it to
resemble a shaggy cloth; these Ramdohr calls <i>shags</i>
(<i>zotte</i><a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>), and Cuvier, <i>hairs</i><a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> (<i>villi</i>). These appendages
the latter author seems to regard as organs that secrete
the gastric juice and render it to the stomach<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>; but the
former thinks their use uncertain<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>.</p>

<p>3. The <i>small intestines</i> (<i>Intestina parva</i>) are the portion
of intestines next the stomach, and consist often of
<i>three</i> distinct canals;&mdash;the first is supposed to be analogous
to the <i>duodenum</i>; it is found only in the Coleopterous
genera <i>Silpha</i> L. and <i>Lampyris</i> L., and is distinguished
from the succeeding intestine by being perfectly
smooth<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>. Next follows the <i>thin intestine</i> (<i>Dünndarm</i>),
which in the above insects is wrinkled; it most
commonly immediately follows the stomach. Sometimes
it is wholly wanting, as in <i>Agrion</i>, the <i>Hemiptera</i><a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>,
&amp;c. Ramdohr conjectures that it is not solely destined
for conveying the excrement, but that probably
some juices are separated in it from the food especially
for the nutrition of the gall-vessels, as their principal
convolutions are mostly near this intestine<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>; which perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
may in some cases be regarded as analogous to the
<i>jejunum</i> in vertebrate animals. The third pair of the
small intestines, which perhaps represents the <i>ileum</i>,
Ramdohr distinguishes by the name of <i>club-shaped</i>
(<i>Keulförmigen Darm</i><a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>). It may generally be regarded
as only a continuation of the former thickened at the
end so as to resemble a club reversed. It is however
sometimes <i>separated</i> from the thin intestine, as in <i>Cerambyx
moschatus</i><a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>.</p>

<p>4. The <i>large intestines</i> (<i>Intestina magna</i>) consist sometimes
of two portions. The <i>thick intestine</i> (<i>Dicken-darm</i>),
which may be regarded as a kind of <i>c&#339;cum</i>, is
found only in the larvæ of the Lamellicorn beetles, but
never in the perfect insect. In shape it is oval and
folded; whence it is thicker than the rest of the intestinal
canal, and is constantly filled with excrement<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>. The
second portion of these intestines is the <i>rectum</i> (<i>Mastdarm</i>),
which terminates in the anal passage. This part
is scarcely ever wanting, except when the insect evacuates
no excrement, which is the case with the grubs of
bees, wasps, and the antlion (<i>Myrmeleon</i>). In the imago
of <i>Telephorus</i>, at least in <i>T. fuscus</i>, it is also obsolete<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>:
in most cases, however, it is very distinct from
the preceding intestine. Sometimes it consists of only
one tunick composed of muscular fibres<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>. When the
gullet is wide, the <i>rectum</i> is usually so likewise; but
when it follows a club-shaped or thick intestine, it is
narrow<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>. It generally may be termed <i>short</i><a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
wide, it often contains a great quantity of excrement, as
the gullet does of undigested food; but when narrow,
the excrement seldom remains long in it. This intestine
also in a few cases has a lateral enlargement or
<i>c&#339;cum</i> (<i>Blind-darm</i>), being a continuation of the same
skin; but perhaps this enlargement is really analogous
to what Ramdohr calls the <i>thick intestine</i>, though in
these cases he regards it as an appendage of the rectum<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>.</p>

<p>I must now call your attention to the <i>bile-vessels</i> of
insects. These, by Malpighi<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and the earlier physiologists,
who regarded them as a kind of <i>lacteals</i>, were denominated
<i>varicose</i> vessels: but Cuvier&mdash;and his opinion
after some hesitation has been adopted by Ramdohr&mdash;considers
them as vessels for the secretion of <i>bile</i>, and
as analogous to the <i>liver</i> of animals that have a circulation<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>.
As the want of blood-vessels prevents insects
from having any gland, the bile is produced with them,
as all their other secretions, by slender vessels that float
in their nutritive fluid, and from thence secrete the elements
proper to form that important product, which
usually tinges them with its own yellow hue; though in
the Lamellicorns and Capricorns they are of an opaque
white, and in the <i>Dytisci</i> of a deep brown colour<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>. Their
bitter taste further proves that they contain the bile<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>.
They are long, slender, filiform, tortuous or convoluted,
and mostly simple vessels; sometimes gradually smaller
toward the base<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>, at others towards the apex<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
some, screw-shaped<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>: in one larva, with hemispherical
elevations<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>: in the cockchafer, part of them are fringed
on each side with an infinity of short, blind, minute,
setiform tubes, while the rest are naked<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>; they are
composed of a single, thin, transparent membrane, according
to Ramdohr<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>; but Cuvier thinks their texture
is spongy<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>. They appear to contain a number of small,
irregular, dark granules, which float in a peculiar fluid,
with which, however, they are not always filled throughout,
nor are they constantly permeable from one end to
the other. Thus in the meal-worm beetle (<i>Tenebrio
Molitor</i>), the common trunk by which they are attached
to the intestinal canal is composed of gelatinous granules<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>.
The place of their insertion is generally a little
below the <i>pylorus</i>, but in the common cockroach they
are inserted into the stomach just above that part<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>.
Usually each vessel opens singly into the intestinal canal,
which the whole number surround at an equal distance
from each other<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>. Sometimes, however, they are
connected with it by a common tube in which they all
unite, as in the asparagus-beetle (<i>Lema Asparagi</i><a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>), and
the mole-cricket (<i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i><a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>); in the house-fly
(<i>Musca domestica</i>), and other <i>Muscidæ</i>, each pair
unites so as to form a single branch on each side of the
canal previously to their insertion<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>; in the field-cricket
(<i>Gryllus campestris</i>) they are all inserted in one spot<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and when numerous, they are generally attached singly
though irregularly<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>. These vessels at their base do
not open into the cavity of the intestinal canal, but merely
into the space between its outer and inner tunicks, the
last being constantly imperforated<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to their <i>apex</i>, the bile-vessels are sometimes
<i>fixed</i> singly or connectedly to the intestine merely
by a few muscular fibres; for they do not enter it, their
ends having no orifice. This structure is mostly to be met
with in the <i>Coleoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>. In caterpillars, the tops of these
vessels perforate the outer skin of the rectum, and proceeding
in dense convolutions to the anus, become at last
so fine that their terminations cannot be discovered<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>.
In other cases, the extremities of a pair of these vessels
<i>unite</i> so as to form a double one: this may be seen in those
of <i>Philonthus politus</i><a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>, and probably other rove-beetles:
and lastly, in others the bile-vessels are <i>free</i>, hanging
down by the intestinal canal, without being attached to it
or to each other. This structure is constantly found
in the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Hymenoptera</i> Orders, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to their <i>number</i>, the bile-vessels vary from
two to upwards of one hundred and fifty, yet so that
their whole amount is constantly the product of the number
two,&mdash;at least as far as they have been counted: and
even when those on one side are not alike, a similar variation
takes place in the other, as may be seen in <i>Galleruca
Vitellinæ</i>, where on each side are two long ones
and one shorter<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>; the most usual numbers are, <i>four</i>&mdash;<i>six</i>&mdash;or
<i>many</i>, that is, more than <i>twenty</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>The bile-vessels vary considerably in <i>length</i>: in many
cases where they are <i>free</i> they are <i>short</i><a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>; they are often
very long, and perhaps those that are <i>fixed</i> may be generally
stated as the longest. In the Lamellicorn beetles
they are remarkable for their great length<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.</p>

<p>Having given you this general account of the intestinal
canal and its parts and appendages, I shall now state
some of the peculiarities that in this respect distinguish
particular tribes and families.</p>

<p>The <i>Coleoptera</i> alone, exhibit as many variations in
the structure of the alimentary tube as all the other Orders
of insects together:&mdash;to particularize these would
occupy too large a portion of this letter, I shall therefore
only notice a few of the most remarkable. In general
they may be stated as having universally a stomach, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
small intestine and rectum, and not more than <i>three</i> pairs
of <i>fixed</i> or <i>united</i> bile-vessels. In the Predaceous beetles,
the <i>gullet</i> mostly widens at the base into a considerable
<i>crop</i>, followed by a <i>gizzard</i>, a shaggy <i>stomach</i>, and two
pairs of <i>united</i> bile-vessels. The whole alimentary canal
in these, is never less than <i>double</i>, and sometimes <i>treble</i>
the length of the body<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>. In the <i>carnivorous</i> beetles, at
least the <i>Staphylinidæ</i> and <i>Silphidæ</i>, there is little or no
<i>crop</i>, and the <i>gizzard</i> is hidden: in the former, the whole
length of the intestinal canal is not <i>twice</i>, while in the
latter it is more than <i>four</i> times that of the body<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. In
these also the intermediate portion of the large intestine
is singularly annulated<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>. In the <i>Petalocera</i> the <i>stomach</i>
is usually longer than all the rest of the intestines together,
and often convoluted: in the cockchafer the
whole intestinal canal is nearly <i>five</i> times the length of
the body, <i>four</i> parts of which is occupied by the stomach<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>.
In the grub the canal scarcely exceeds the length of the
animal<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. In <i>Lampyris</i> the stomach exhibits a remarkable
appearance, having on each side a series of spherical
<i>folds</i> or <i>vesicles</i><a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>. Have these any thing to do with
the secretion of its phosphoric matter? <i>Tenebrio</i> has a
<i>gizzard</i> armed internally with calluses, and a shaggy stomach,
and <i>Blaps</i> does not differ materially; their entire
canal is more than twice the length of the body<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>. In the
<i>vesicatory</i> beetles (<i>Cantharis</i>, <i>Meloe</i>, &amp;c.) there is no <i>gizzard</i>,
and the canal is less than twice the length of the
body<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>. Little is known with regard to the alimentary
canal of the beetles distinguished by a <i>rostrum</i> (<i>Rhyncophora</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
In the only two that appear to have been examined,
<i>Rhynchites Betuleti</i> and <i>Cryptorhynchus Lapathi</i>,
that canal is moderately long, the stomach partially
shaggy, and the small intestine inversely claviform; but
in other respects they differ materially<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>. In the former
there is no crop or gizzard, the stomach is fringed on
each side, except at its upper extremity, with a series of
small <i>c&#339;ca</i> or shags, and there are <i>three</i> pairs of bile-vessels<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>;
while in the latter the gullet is dilated into a
crop which includes a gizzard in which the skill of a
<span class="smcap">Divine</span> artist is singularly conspicuous:&mdash;though so
minute as scarcely to exceed a large pin's head in size,
it is stated to be armed internally with more than 400
pairs of teeth, moved by an infinitely greater number of
muscles<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>. A transverse section of this gizzard represents
two concentric stars, with nine rays each<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>: the object of
this structure is, the comminution of the timber which
this beetle has to perforate and probably devour<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>. The
stomach is very slender, but dilates in the middle into a
spherical vesicle<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>, and there are only two pairs of bile-vessels<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>.
In the <i>Capricorn</i> beetles, the part we are considering
varies much: in general we may observe that it
is more than <i>double</i> the length of the body, that the stomach
is long and slender, and usually naked, that the
gullet terminates in a crop without a distinct gizzard,
and that there are <i>three</i> pairs of bile-vessels<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>. In the
Herbivorous beetles (<i>Chrysomela</i>, <i>Cassida</i>, &amp;c.) the canal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
is more than double the length of the body, and in some
much longer<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>, the stomach is long, and commonly
naked; but in <i>Chrysomela violacea</i> it is covered with
hemispherical prominences<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>, and in <i>Chrysomela Populi</i>
it is shaggy<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>; in the insect last named and <i>Galleruca
Vitellinæ</i> the rectum consists of <i>two</i> pieces<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>. In this
tribe the intestines of the larva resemble those of the
perfect insect<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Orthoptera</i> the alimentary canal, which continues
the same in every state, is short, or only moderately
long; the gullet has one or two lateral pouches or crops<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>,
and terminates in a gizzard of curious construction, with
singular folds and teeth<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>; then follows a short stomach,
usually with a pair or more of <i>c&#339;ca</i> at its upper extremity<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>;
the lower intestines are not distinct, and the bile-vessels
numerous, short and free<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Neuroptera</i>, many of the genera are distinguished
by the remarkable length of the gullet, and by
the lower intestines forming one short piece<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>. In the <i>Libellulina</i>
the bile-vessels are numerous, short, and free,
as in the <i>Orthoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>. In <i>Hemerobius</i> and <i>Myrmeleon</i>
there is a gizzard<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>, and just above it a <i>c&#339;cum</i>, in the former
very remarkable, is connected with the gullet<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Hymenoptera</i> appear all to be distinguished by a
long slender gullet, terminating in a dilated crop forming
the honey-bag; their stomach is variable, their small
intestine slender, and the rectum dilated;&mdash;their bile-vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
like those of the two preceding Orders, are numerous,
short, and free<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>. In the ants and ichneumons there
is an approach to a gizzard<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>. In the wasp and humble-bee
the stomach is very long, with muscular rings surrounding
it<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>. In this Order the larvæ at first have no
lower intestines and void no excrement<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>, but as they approach
to the pupa state one begins to appear<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>.</p>

<p>The next insects whose alimentary canal we are to
consider, are those which, taking their food by <i>suction</i>,
have no occasion for masticating organs: this may in
part be predicated of the preceding Order, in which
most of the tribes in their perfect state <i>imbibe</i> fluid food,
and use the ordinary organs of <i>mastication</i> principally in
operations connected with their economy; and their crop,
in which the honey in many is stored up for regurgitation,
may be regarded in some degree as analogous to the
food-bag of the <i>Diptera</i> and other suctorious insects.</p>

<p>The two sections of the <i>Hemiptera</i> Order differ widely
in the canal we are considering, and I shall therefore
give a separate account of each. In the <i>Heteropterous</i>
section, appended to the gullet by a long convoluted capillary
tube, besides the usual saliva-reservoirs there is
often a double vessel, which Ramdohr regards as discharging
the same function, but which in many respects
seems rather analogous to the food-reservoir of the <i>Diptera</i><a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>.
As I have had no opportunity of examining this
vessel, I shall content myself with stating this idea, and
describe the vessel more fully hereafter. The gullet, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
these, usually terminates in an ample crop consisting of
many folds<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>, followed by a long, slender, cylindrical
tube, dilated at its base into a spherical tumour; these
two may be said to form the first stomach: to this succeeds
a second<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>, which Ramdohr denominates the <i>bug</i>-stomach
(<i>Wanzen-magen</i>), which varies in its figure, and
in <i>Pentatoma</i> consists of four demi-tubes, so as to form a
quadrangular canal<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>. In the <i>Homopterous</i> section of
this Order Ramdohr seems to have examined but few;
<i>Chermes</i> however and <i>Aphis</i> exhibit one remarkable feature;
they have <i>no bile-vessels</i>, at least he could discover
no trace of these organs<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>. Their intestinal canal is very
simple, their stomach very long, widest above, and somewhat
convoluted, with a very slender gullet<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>. In <i>Cercopis
spumaria</i> the structure is more complex, and extremely
singular. It has <i>two</i> or rather <i>three</i> stomachs;
the two first of a <i>horny</i> substance, and the last a slender
somewhat convoluted <i>membranous</i> tube, which becoming
reversed, is attached by what should be deemed
its lower extremity to the first stomach, from the other
side of which emerge the lower intestines, terminating in
a thick pear-shaped rectum. At the same point of the
first stomach the four bile-vessels are attached, they
grow gradually thicker for about a third of their length,
when they become twisted like a cord, and taper towards
the rectum, to which also they are attached<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>. From
this structure it should seem that the food has to pass
twice through the first stomach, before the process of
digestion is complete, and it is rejected at the anus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The next suctorious Order is the <i>Lepidoptera</i>: in
these the gullet is long and slender, surrounded at the
beginning with a loose transparent skin, and at the base
furnished with a pair of lateral sacs, forming the honey-stomach,
and probably analogous to the food-reservoirs
of the <i>Diptera</i>, which when blown up are of an oval
form; the stomach, as in the bugs, consists of <i>two</i> portions,
the first being the longest<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>. There are three <i>free</i>
bile-vessels on each side, proceeding from a single
branch<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>. It will not be uninteresting here to abstract
from Herold the progressive changes which take place
in the intestinal canal in this Order, during the transition
of the animal from the larva to the imago state. In the
<i>larva</i>, the gullet, the small intestine, and the rectum, are
short and thick<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>, there are a pair of silk reservoirs (<i>sericteria</i>),
as well as vessels for the secretion of saliva
(<i>sialisteria</i>): if you examine it two days after its first
change, you will find the gullet and the small intestine
much lengthened and become very slender; the stomach
contracted both in length and size; the rectum also
changed, and the silk vessels contracted<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>. These in a
<i>pupa</i> eight days old have wholly disappeared; the gullet
is become still longer, its base is dilated into a crop or
food-reservoir; the stomach is still more contracted, and
instead of a cylinder represents a spindle; the small intestine
also is lengthened<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>: at a still more advanced period,
when it is near appearing under its last form, the
gullet and small intestine are still more drawn out; and
the honey-bag, though very minute, has become a lateral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
appendage of the gullet<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>; and lastly, in the butterfly it
appears as a large vesicle<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>; the small intestine is grown
very long<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>; and the rectum has changed its form and acquired
a c&#339;cum<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>. When we consider the adaptation of
all these changes of form, the loss of old organs and the
acquisition of new ones, to the new functions and mode
of life of the animal, we see evidently the all-powerful
hand of that <span class="smcap">Almighty Being</span> who created the universe,
upholding by his providence, and the law that he has
given to every creature, the system that he at first brought
into existence.</p>

<p>We now come to the <i>Diptera</i>. These have a very slender
gullet, to which is attached on one side a long filiform
tube, terminating in the food-reservoir, which in
some instances is simple<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>, but most generally consists of
two or more vessels<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>, collapsing when empty, but varying
in shape and size when inflated with food: the mouth
of the stomach in many cases is dilated into a kind of
ring<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>; sometimes there is on each side a blind appendage
or <i>c&#339;cum</i> opening into it, in <i>Bombylius</i> covered with
shags, which though not connected with the mouth by a
tube, Ramdohr regards as saliva-reservoirs<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>; in <i>Musca
vomitoria</i> the beginning of this organ below the mouth
is covered with hemispherical prominences, and in <i>Tipula</i>
it is dilated and marked with transverse folds. There
are usually <i>two</i> pairs of bile-vessels; in the <i>Muscidæ</i>
pedunculate and <i>free</i><a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>; in <i>Tipula</i>, <i>Bombylius</i>, and <i>Leptis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
sessile and <i>united</i><a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>; and in <i>Tabanus</i> sessile and <i>fixed</i><a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>.
It is remarkable that in some of this Order&mdash;the reverse
of what usually happens&mdash;the alimentary canal appears
to be much longer in the larva than it is in the imago;
in <i>Musca vomitoria</i>, its length in the <i>former</i> is two inches
and a quarter, while in the <i>latter</i> it is only one inch and
one third<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>. A singular organ distinguishes the imago
of this species, the use of which appears not to be discovered.
It succeeds the <i>rectum</i>, and has on each side
two short club-shaped appendages, open at the end,
which receive <i>tracheæ</i>, and terminate in a short piece
that opens into the anus<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>.</p>

<p>In <i>Hippobosca</i> and its affinities the canal in question
differs from that of other <i>Diptera</i>, in having no food-reservoir;
in other respects it resembles it<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>.</p>

<p>From the above statement it appears that the principal
character which distinguishes those that take their
food by <i>suction</i>, from those that <i>masticate</i> it, is the faculty
with which they are furnished by means of an ample
crop, honey-stomach, or food-reservoir, of <i>regurgitating</i>
the food they may have stored up. Another distinction
still more striking, which will appear more evidently
hereafter, is to be seen in the <i>saliva-secretors</i> with which
the <i>suctorious</i> tribes are furnished, to be found in very
few <i>masticators</i>, by which they are enabled to render
the juices more fluid and fit for suction.</p>

<p>The only insect amongst the <i>Aptera</i> whose alimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
canal I shall notice, is the common harvest-man (<i>Phalangium
Opilio</i>): in this, though the stomach and lower
intestine are remarkably simple, yet their c&#339;cal appendages
are numerous and singular: the former, which
has no distinct gullet, is pear-shaped<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>; and the latter,
tapering downwards, and truncated at the end<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>; connected
with it above are no less than twenty-three <i>c&#339;ca</i>
or blind appendages, of various forms and dimensions;
the last pair but one of which is very remarkable, being
bent like a bow, and furnished externally with four short
clavate processes<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>. It is probable that some of these organs
are analogous to the bile-vessels of other insects.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Creator</span> in his wisdom fixed the limits of
the various tribes of animals, he united them all into one
harmonious system by means of certain intermediate
forms, exhibiting characters taken some from those that
were to precede, and others from those that were to follow
them, and this not only in their <i>external</i> structure,
but likewise in their <i>internal</i> organization; so that we are
not to wonder if in the same individual we meet with
organs that belong to two distinct tribes, or if, remaining
nearly the <i>same</i> in their <i>prima facie</i> appearance, they begin
to exercise <i>new</i> functions. An instance of this we
have seen in the dorsal vessel of insects, which in the
<i>Arachnida</i>, though not materially different in situation
or general form, by the addition of a small apparatus of
arteries and veins becomes the centre and fountain of a
regular system of circulation<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>. From the circumstances
here alluded to, physiologists have been led to entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
very different sentiments with regard to the structure of
the alimentary organs of the Class we are now to enter
upon, the <i>Arachnida</i>: what some regard as a real <i>liver</i>,
others look upon as an <i>epiploon</i> or caul; and what the
last denominate <i>bile</i>-vessels are by some of the former
considered as appropriated to the secretion of <i>chyle</i><a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>.
Yet both these opinions have some foundation in nature.
When, in the <i>Arachnida</i>, we discover a lobular substance
consisting of granules filling the whole cavity of the body
and wrapped round the intestines, every one will see in
it no small analogy to the <i>epiploon</i> which in insects performs
the same function: but when, upon a further examination,
we detect certain vessels communicating with
this substance and the intestinal canal<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>, the idea that
these may be <i>hepatic ducts</i>, and this substance analogous
to the <i>liver</i>, immediately strikes us as not improbable.
Again: when we discover pairs of other capillary and
tortuous vessels connecting with the intestinal canal either
at the <i>pylorus</i><a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> or below it<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>, which in appearance strikingly
resemble the bile-vessels which we so constantly
find in insects, we seem warranted in concluding that they
are of the same nature and use: but when a nearer inspection
enables us to detect the hepatic ducts just mentioned
in the scorpion, and we find that these capillary
vessels in the spider are in a very different situation from
those in insects which we suppose them to represent, it
occurs to us as not unlikely, that their <i>function</i> may be
different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now consider how the intestinal canal is circumstanced
in the two sections into which the Class
<i>Arachnida</i> is divided; the <i>Scorpionidea</i>, and <i>Araneidea</i>.
In the Scorpions, this organ proceeds from the mouth
to the anus without any flexure or convolution, so that
its length is scarcely equal to that of the body<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>; it is
slender, and its diameter, with the exception of an irregular
dilatation here and there, is nearly the same in
its whole extent; the gullet is short; the stomach long,
and nearly cylindrical; the <i>duodenum</i> shorter and thicker
than the stomach, from which, as well as from the <i>rectum</i>,
it is separated by a valve; the latter is cylindrical, and
opens at the anus above the insertion of the vesicle that
secretes the poison<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>. With regard to the <i>biliary</i> system
and its organs: The <i>liver</i> is of a pulpy granular consistence
and of a brownish colour, fills the whole cavity of
the trunk and abdomen, and serves as a bed for the other
intestines. It is divided longitudinally into two portions,
by the channel in which the heart reposes&mdash;its anterior
part is formed into many irregular lobes, by the sinuosities
of the trunk; at the other extremity, it terminates in
two acute ends, which enter the first joint of the tail; its
surface presents a reticular appearance, the result of the
approximation of polygonous <i>lobuli</i>; its interior is a tissue
of infinitely minute glands: in <i>Scorpio occitanus</i> there are
about forty pyramidal <i>lobuli</i> detached from each other,
the summits of which, by their union, form bunches that
have their excretory canals, varying in number in different
species, which convey the bile to the alimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
tube; in the above insect there are six pairs, three in the
trunk and three in the abdomen, and in <i>S. Europæus</i> a
smaller number<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>; these vessels run transversely from the
liver, or aggregation of conglomerate glands, to the intestinal
canal<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>; the bunches consist of an infinite number
of spherical glands, generally filled with a brown thick
fluid<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>: besides the transverse vessels, from the base of
the stomach there issue two pairs of very slender tortuous
ones, seemingly analogous to the common bile-vessels;
one pair of which runs upwards, one on each
side that organ towards the mouth, forming here and
there some ramifications which enter the liver; and the
other runs nearly transversely to it<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>. As the fluid contained
in these vessels is different from that contained in
the glands of the liver, M. Marcel de Serres supposes
they may be chyliferous<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Araneidea</i> also the alimentary canal is nearly
straight, and scarcely exceeds the length of the body:
the <i>gullet</i> is rather thick and cylindrical<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>; the <i>stomach</i>
is distinguished anteriorly by two pairs of sacs, the
upper pair being much the largest and nearly triangular,
the lower linear<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>; from these sacs a narrow tube
runs towards the <i>rectum</i>, but which is so entangled with
the liver, muscles, &amp;c., as not to be easily made out<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>; the
<i>rectum</i> is rather tumid, and has a lateral <i>c&#339;cum</i><a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>. The
disposition of the liver or conglomerate glands is stated
to be similar to that of the scorpion<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>; it is usually white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
but in some species it is yellowish, or reddish, and its
lower surface has sometimes regular excavations<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>; no
transverse hepatic ducts connecting it with the alimentary
canal, as in the scorpion, appear to have been at present
discovered: two pairs of capillary <i>free</i> vessels are attached
to the base of the <i>rectum</i> on one side, which, except
in their situation, seem analogous to the bile-vessels
of insects<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>.</p>

<p>From the above detailed account of the alimentary
canal of the animals whose internal anatomy we are considering,
it appears that M. Cuvier's observation&mdash;that
the length and complication of the intestines indicate a
less substantial kind of nutriment&mdash;does not hold universally:
thus, in <i>Necrophorus</i> and <i>Silpha</i>, <i>carnivorous</i> insects,
the intestinal canal in its length and convolutions exceeds
those of most <i>herbivorous</i> ones, and in <i>Cassida viridis</i> and
some others of the <i>latter</i> tribe are not longer than those
of the <i>predaceous</i> beetles. In <i>herbivorous larvæ</i> also, in
general, the length of the alimentary canal does not exceed
that of the body, but in those of some <i>flesh</i>-flies
(<i>Musca vomitoria</i>) it very greatly exceeds it<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>. So true
is the observation&mdash;that there is no general rule without
exceptions.</p>

<p>In this letter it may not be out of place to say a few
words upon the <i>excrements</i> of insects; which, strange as
the observation may seem, but it is no less true than
strange, are sometimes pleasing to the eye, from their
symmetry, and to the taste, from their sweetness. In
those that masticate their food they are solid, and in
those that take it by suction, fluid or semi-fluid. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
caterpillars of <i>Lepidoptera</i> they are of the former description,
and every grain wears some resemblance to an
insect's egg: as the passage in many of these consists of
<i>six</i> fleshy parts separated by channels, so the excrement
represents six little prisms separated by six channels<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>.
The <i>Aphides</i> all secrete a fluid excrement as sweet as
honey, of which the ants are so fond<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>, which is ejected
not only at the anal passage, but, in many, by two little
siphonets also above it<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>. A semi-fluid excrement is produced
by some species of <i>Chermes</i>, as that which inhabits
the Box, which often comes from the animal in long convoluted
strings resembling vermicelli. Reaumur says its
taste is agreeable, much more so than that of manna<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>.
Under this head should be included the abundant spume
with which the larva of <i>Cercopis spumaria</i> envelopes itself<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>.</p>

<h3><i>INTERNAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
OF INSECTS, CONTINUED.</i></h3>

<h5>SECRETION.</h5>


<p>Having given you so full an account of the system of
<i>digestion</i> in insects, I am now to say something concerning
their <i>secretions</i>, and the organs by which they are
elaborated. Though no individual amongst them perhaps
secretes so many different substances as the warm-blooded
animals; yet in general the Class abounds in
secretions perhaps as numerous and extraordinary as in
the last-mentioned tribes, to some of which a few of them
are analogous, while others are altogether peculiar. We
know little or nothing of the mode in which the process
of secretion in insects is accomplished; in most cases we
cannot even discover, except in general, whence the secreted
substance originates; and in others, though we are
able to trace the vessels that contain it, we are often in
the dark as to their structure.&mdash;Cuvier, as has been before
hinted, from not being able to detect any thing in
them like <i>glands</i>, and from their being constantly bathed
in the <i>blood</i> or nutritive fluid, conceives that they separate
the peculiar substances they contain, by imbibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
or infiltration, through the pores of the skin<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>; a circumstance
which seems to indicate a certain conformation
of the pores both as to size and figure, so as to
enable them to admit only one peculiar product.</p>

<p>In treating on this subject, I shall first consider the
<i>organs</i> of secretion, and next their <i>products</i>.</p>

<p>I. <i>Organs of Secretion.</i> In general, these are membranous
vessels that float in the blood or nutritive fluid,
and secrete from it a peculiar substance. They may be
denominated according to their products&mdash;<i>Silk-secretors</i>,
<i>Saliva-secretors</i>, <i>Varnish-secretor</i>, <i>Jelly</i> or <i>Gluten-secretor</i>,
<i>Poison-secretor</i>, and <i>Scent-secretors</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Silk-Secretors</i> (<i>Sericteria</i>). These organs are most
remarkable in the caterpillars of the <i>nocturnal Lepidoptera</i>
or moths, especially in that tribe called <i>Bombyces</i>,
to which the silkworm belongs: but this faculty is not
confined to these insects, but is shared by many other
<i>larvæ</i> in different Orders; and in one instance at least, by
the <i>imago</i>. In general, the outlet of the silk-secretors is
at the <i>mouth</i>; sometimes, however, as in the larva of
<i>Myrmeleon</i> and the imago of <i>Hydrophilus</i>, its exit is at
the <i>anus</i>. The first is the organ which in the silk-worm
provides for us that beautiful substance from which the
animal takes its name. There are always <i>two</i> of these
vessels, which are long floating tubes, growing slender
towards the head of the insect, where they unite to form
the spinneret (<i>fusulus</i>) before described<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>, which renders
the silk. Their lower extremity also is commonly more
slender than the middle, and is closed at the end. These
organs are usually very much convoluted and twisted<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
According to Ramdohr<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>, they consist of two transparent
membranes, between which is found a yellow or
transparent jelly. The greater the quantity of silk employed
by the caterpillar in the construction of its cocoon,
&amp;c., the longer are the silk-secretors. Those of
the silkworm are a <i>foot</i> long<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>, while those of the larva
of the goat-moth are little more than <i>three inches</i><a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>.</p>

<p>Other insects spin silk with the <i>posterior</i> extremity
of their body. In the great water-beetle (<i>Hydrophilus
piceus</i>) the anus is furnished with two spinnerets, with
which it spins its egg-pouch<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>; these are in connexion,
probably, with the five long and large vessels containing
a green fluid, described by Cuvier<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>, which surround the
base of each branch of the ovaries. The larva of <i>Myrmeleon</i>,
which also spins a cocoon with its anus, differs
remarkably in this respect from other insects, since its
reservoir for the matter of silk is the <i>rectum</i>; this is connected
with a horny tube, which the animal can protrude,
and thus agglutinate the silk and grains of sand
that compose its cocoon<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>web</i> of spiders is also a kind of <i>silk</i> remarkable
for its lightness and extreme tenuity. It is spun from
four anal spinnerets, which never vary in number; two
longer organs peculiar to some species have been mistaken
for additional ones, but Treviranus affirms that
they are merely a kind of anal <i>feeler</i>. Their structure,
as far as known, has been before described<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>. The web
is secreted in vessels varying in form. In some (<i>Clubiona</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<i>atrox</i>) they consist of two larger and two smaller ones,
at the base of which lie many still more minute<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>. The
four larger vessels are wide in the middle, branching at
top, and below terminating in a narrow canal leading to
the spinnerets<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>. Treviranus thinks the fluid contained
in the lower minute vessels different from that furnished
by the larger ones&mdash;but for what purpose it is employed
has not been ascertained.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Saliva-secretors</i> (<i>Sialisteria</i>). These are organs,
rendering a fluid to the mouth or stomach, that are found
in many insects, especially those that take their food by
<i>suction</i>, as the <i>Hemiptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and <i>Diptera</i>,
though they are not confined to the perfect insect, being
also in some cases visible in the larva. Swammerdam
was one of the first that discovered them, and he suspects
that they may be <i>salival</i> vessels; though he, as well as
Ramdohr, thinks they are the same with the <i>silk</i> vessels
of the caterpillar<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>; an opinion which Herold has sufficiently
disproved, by showing that at one period of the
insect's life they co-exist<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>, and Lyonet discovered a very
conspicuous pair in the caterpillar of the Cossus, co-existent
with the silk-secretors<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>. But the physiologist who
has given the fullest account of these organs is Ramdohr:&mdash;I
shall therefore extract chiefly from him what I have
further to communicate with respect to them.</p>

<p>They are variously constructed blind vessels, that are
present in almost all insects that take their food by <i>suction</i>,
but are mostly wanting in those that <i>masticate</i> it.
They have been found, however, in <i>Cryptorhynchus Lapathi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<i>Chrysopa Perla</i>, and <i>Iulus terrestris</i>. The most
usual number of the saliva-secretors is <i>two</i><a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>; but sometimes,
as in the first of the last-named insects, there is
only <i>one</i><a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>; in others (<i>Pentatoma Baccarum</i>) there are
<i>three</i>, the exterior one consisting of a pair of reservoirs
connecting with the gullet by a single capillary tube<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>; in
<i>Pentatoma prasina</i> there appear to be <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>; in <i>Nepa
cinerea</i>, even <i>six</i>&mdash;the exterior double pair in this insect,
under a powerful lens, is found to consist of spherical
vesicles, resembling somewhat a bunch of currants<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>; and
in <i>Syrphus arcuatus</i> they are covered with <i>four</i> rows of
similar ones<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>. In the flea they consist of two pair of
spherical reservoirs, each of which is connected with a
short tube, which uniting with that of the other forms a
common capillary one connecting with the mouth or
gullet<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>; these organs sometimes terminate below in
slender vessels;&mdash;thus, in <i>Nepa</i>, the inner pair terminates
in a single vessel of this description<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>, and in <i>Tabanus</i> and
<i>Hemerobius</i> apparently in many<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>. It admits of a doubt
however, as was lately observed, whether in the <i>Hemiptera</i>,
which have usually more than a <i>pair</i> of these organs,
some are not rather <i>food-reservoirs</i> as in the <i>Diptera</i>.</p>

<p>The saliva-secretors open either into the <i>instruments</i>
of <i>suction</i> themselves (<i>Tabanus</i>, <i>Musca</i>); or into the entrance
of the <i>gullet</i> (<i>Pentatoma</i>, &amp;c.); or, lastly, into that
of the <i>stomach</i> (<i>Syrphus</i>, <i>Bombylius</i>). Those which lie at
the entrance of the <i>stomach</i> consist only of a blind uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<i>tube</i><a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>; but there is commonly to be distinguished in
those that open into the <i>mouth</i>, a <i>reservoir</i>, varying in
shape in different species, and terminating in a capillary
tube, or tubes, at one or both extremities<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>. In Bugs,
<i>two</i> pair of these vessels are often present, one of which
opens into the stomach (<i>Reduvius</i>), or gullet (<i>Pentatoma</i>),
but the other into the instruments of suction<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>. In the
<i>Diptera</i> they open into the stomach when the insect feeds
only upon the nectar of flowers (<i>Syrphus</i>), and into the
proboscis when it feeds upon both animal and vegetable
juices (<i>Tabanus</i>, <i>Musca</i>). The function of the fluid secreted
by these organs is to moisten or dilute the food
before it is received by the instruments of suction and
passed to the stomach<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>. When a common house-fly applies
its proboscis to a piece of sugar, it is easy to see
that it moistens and dissolves it by some fluid.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Varnish-secretor</i> (<i>Colleterium</i>). In butterflies,
moths, and several other insects, one or more vessels
called blind vessels open into the oviduct, concerning
the use of which, physiologists are not agreed. In the
cabbage butterfly there is a pair of ovate ones, or rather
a bilobed one, each lobe of which externally terminates
in long perplexed convolutions, not easily traced, filled
with a yellow fluid, which Reaumur and Herold think
is used for varnishing or gumming the eggs, so that they
may adhere to the leaves on which they are deposited:
it may probably serve likewise for other uses<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>. Another
vessel is also to be found in the above butterfly, which enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the oviduct above this, filled with a thick white fluid,
the function of which is, probably, to lubricate the passage<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.
A similar organ is found in <i>Phryganea grandis</i><a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>.</p>

<p>iv. <i>Jelly-secretor</i> (<i>Corysterium</i>). This is a remarkable
organ, related to the preceding, which secretes the jelly
of <i>Trichoptera</i>, some <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c.; this organ in the former,
at least in <i>Phryganea grandis</i>, is of an irregular
shape, with four horns or processes<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Poison-secretor</i> (<i>Ioterium</i>). This organ, which is most
conspicuous in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> Order, has not received
much notice, except in the case of the Hive-bee and the
<i>Scolia</i>: in the former, it is an elliptical membranous
vesicle or reservoir, furnished at its lower extremity with
a tube which renders to the sting, and at the other by a
blind, long, filiform, secretory, vessel, which according to
Swammerdam divides into <i>two</i> terminal blind branches<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>,
though Reaumur could detect but <i>one</i><a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>; in this vessel the
poison is secreted and stored up. In <i>Scolia</i> there are
two secretory vessels, which enter the reservoir in the
middle on each side<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>. In the <i>Scorpion</i>, we learn from
Marcel de Serres that the poison-secretor is clothed externally
with a horny thickish membrane, containing
two yellowish glands, composed of an infinity of spherical
glandules, terminating in a canal, enlarged towards
its base so as to form a reservoir, and leading to the extremity
of the sting<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>. Connected by a slender tube with
each mandible in <i>spiders</i> is a vessel with spiral folds,
which seems properly to belong to <i>this</i> head&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Treviranus calls it a <i>saliva</i>-vessel<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>&mdash;since in the <i>Mygale
avicularia</i> and other spiders, the effect of the bite is said
to be so venomous as to occasion considerable inflammation,
and sometimes death<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>.</p>

<p>v. <i>Scent-secretors</i> (<i>Osmateria</i>). Amongst other means
with which insects are gifted for the annoyance of their
foes and pursuers, are the powerful <i>scents</i> which many of
them emit when alarmed and in danger. Concerning
the <i>internal</i> organs by which these effluvia are <i>secreted</i>
we possess but little information, but more notice has
been taken of the <i>external</i> ones by which they are <i>emitted</i>.
We may conclude in general, that the secretory
organs are membranous sacs or vesicles, perhaps terminating
in longer or shorter blind filiform vessels, sometimes
secreting a fetid fluid, and at others a fetid gaseous
effluvium. The <i>Iulidæ</i>, at least <i>Iulus</i> and <i>Porcellio</i><a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>, cover
themselves when alarmed, with a <i>fluid</i> of this kind, or
emit one, for this faculty is not peculiar to the species
noticed by Savi. I observed early in the year, when I
handled <i>Iulus terrestris</i>, that it was covered with a slimy
secretion, of a powerful scent, which stained my fingers
of an orange colour. The spiraculiform pores that mark
the sides of the animal are the outlets by which this fluid
is emitted, and not spiracles as has been supposed: each
of these orifices, as we learn from Savi, terminates internally
in a black vesicle, which is the reservoir of the
fluid<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>. The most remarkable insect for its powers of
annoyance in this way, is one on that account called the
<i>bombardier</i> (<i>Brachinus crepitans</i>), which can fire numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
volleys of stinking vapour at its assailants before its
ammunition is exhausted<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>. M. Dufour has given a very
particular account of the organ that secretes this vapour;&mdash;it
consists of a double apparatus, one on each side, in
the cavity of the abdomen, both formed of two distinct
vessels. The <i>first</i>, which is the innermost, presents itself
under two different aspects, according as it is contracted
or dilated: in the former case it is a whitish,
irregularly rounded, soft body, apparently glandular,
placed under the last abdominal segments; communicating
at one end with the reservoir, and terminating constantly
at the other in a very long and slender filament:
in the second case, or when it is dilated, it resembles an
oblong, membranous, diaphanous sac, filled with air,
then occupying the whole length of the abdomen, and
appearing free except where it communicates with the
reservoir. The <i>second</i> vessel or reservoir is a small,
spherical, brown or reddish body, constant in its form,
internally hollow, placed under the last dorsal segment,
precisely above the <i>rectum</i>, and opening by a small pore
into the <i>anus</i><a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>: so that the tail of this little beetle may
be regarded as a battery mounted with two pieces of
cannon, which our alert bombardier fires alternately
without intermission till all his ammunition is expended.
The ground-beetles (<i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i>) in general have a pair
of these anal scent-secretors, which discharge an acrid
and caustic fluid, and sometimes a volatile one<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>. The
external organ of the scent-secretors in <i>Gyrinus</i> consists
of two minute hairy cylindrical retractile tubes, of a red
colour<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>. Numerous insects of other tribes and genera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
emit <i>scents</i> from their anus, and from various other parts
of the body, of which having before given you a very
full account<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>, I shall proceed to the consideration of the
secretions themselves: but first I must observe, that in
many cases, as in some of the cottony and powdery <i>Aphides</i>,
<i>Chermes</i>, &amp;c., the substance secreted appears to be
a transpiration through the pores of the body, a kind of
excretion from the superabundance of its fluid contents<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>.
In many, however, this secretion transpires through appropriate
orifices: thus in <i>Chermes Abietis</i>, which produces
those curious galls resembling the cone of a fir<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>,
the flocoons of seeming cotton that cover it proceed from
little oval concavities on its back, four of which are arranged
in a transverse line on each dorsal segment of
the abdomen: these concavities have minute tubercles
probably terminating in a pore<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>. In <i>Aphis Fagi</i> the
cottony flocoons are almost an inch long<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>secretions</i> of insects may be considered under the
following heads&mdash;<i>Silk</i>; <i>Saliva</i>; <i>Varnish</i> or <i>Gum</i>; <i>Jelly</i>;
<i>Oils</i>; <i>Milk</i>; <i>Honey</i>; <i>Wax</i>; <i>Poisons</i> and <i>Acids</i>; <i>Odorous
fluids</i> and <i>Vapours</i>; and <i>Luminous matter</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Silk.</i> This valuable product of insects, while in the
silk-secretor, assumes in the <i>Lepidoptera</i> the appearance
of a viscid gum, but the moment it is exposed to the air
it hardens into a silken thread. It is remarkable for the
following qualities:&mdash;it dries the instant it comes in contact
with the air; it is then insoluble not only in water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
but in the most active solvents, and even <i>heat</i> has no effect
upon it to melt or soften it: indeed, without these
qualities it would be of no use to us<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>. As soon as it
leaves the spinneret it becomes the thread we call silk,
which being drawn through <i>two</i> orifices is necessarily
<i>double</i> through its whole length. This thread varies
considerably in colour and texture, as has been before
stated<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>, and sometimes resembles cotton or wool rather
than silk. In spiders it is of a much softer and more
tender texture than that of other spinning insects; and
Mr. Murray seems to have proved that it is imbued, in
the case of the gossamer, with negative electricity: in
the <i>sericterium</i> the fluid that produces it is sometimes
white or grey, and at others yellow<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>. A remarkable
gnat (<i>Ceroplatus tipuloides</i>), living on an agaric, carpets
its station of repose and its paths with something between
silk and varnish, which it spins, not in a <i>thread</i>,
but in a <i>broad</i> riband<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Saliva.</i> Many insects have the power of discharging
from their mouth a fluid which seems in some degree
analogous to the <i>saliva</i> of larger animals. Thus many,
as <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Hemiptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c., can dilute
their food, and render it fitter for deglutition. I have
seen a common fly when not employed in eating, emit a
globule of fluid as big as a grain of mustard-seed from
its proboscis, and retract it again. On a former occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
I observed to you that many predaceous, carnivorous,
and some herbivorous beetles, when alarmed emit
a drop of coloured acrid fluid from the mouth<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>. That
this is not secreted in any of the ordinary salival vessels
is evident from Ramdohr's dissections of those beetles<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>,
who, had there been such an organ, would doubtless
have discovered it: but as the stomach of all of them
is distinguished by those minute <i>c&#339;ca</i> or blind vessels,
which he denominates shags (<i>zotten</i>)<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>, perhaps these
may be the secretors of this fluid, probably analogous
to the gastric juice<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>; in which case its <i>primary</i> office
would be the <i>digestion</i> of the food. We are not however
warranted in considering <i>every</i> fluid effused from
the mouth as saliva. The glutinous material with which
wasps cement the woody fibres for their paper edifices<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>;
that with which some sand-wasps moisten the sand which
they scrape away, of which they form the singular tubes
that lead to their nests<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>; and that with which the aphidivorous
larvæ fix themselves previously to their becoming
pupæ<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>,&mdash;may be a secretion distinct from saliva;
possibly intermediate between it and gum or the
matter of silk, and secreted by peculiar organs. In the
wasp, however, Ramdohr discovered nothing of the
kind<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>; and in <i>Syrphus</i>, as before observed, the saliva-secretors
are very peculiar in their structure, as if appropriated
to the secretion of a peculiar fluid<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>. Something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
similar has been observed by Reaumur with regard
to the larva of <i>Crioceris merdigera</i>, which forms its
cocoon with a kind of froth produced from the mouth<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Varnish</i> or <i>Gum</i>. The eggs of various insects, when
they leave the oviduct, are covered with a kind of varnish
or gum by which they adhere to the substances
that the young larvæ are to feed upon, or are placed in
a proper position for their hatching in an appropriate
station. Several instances of this have been already
mentioned<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>; I shall therefore not enlarge further upon
the subject. With regard to the secretion itself, little
has been recorded except its <i>colour</i>, which has been before
noticed. Some <i>Lepidoptera</i> also as we learn from
Reaumur and Bonnet<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>, use a varnish in the construction
of their cocoons.</p>

<p>iv. <i>Jelly</i> or <i>Gluten</i>. This secretion is particularly conspicuous
in the <i>Trichoptera</i> and some <i>Diptera</i>, serving
as a bed or <i>nidus</i> for those eggs that are committed to
the water,&mdash;upon which I have nothing to add to what
has been before said<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>. Under this head also may be
noticed the fluid, secreted in peculiar vesicles, that lubricates
the oviduct and the passages of the sexual organs<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>.</p>

<p>v. <i>Oils.</i> Oily substances are sometimes produced by
insects. The common oil-beetle (<i>Meloe Proscarabæus</i>)
when touched sends forth a drop of this kind of fluid,
of an orange colour, from each joint of its legs<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>: something
similar I have observed in <i>Coccinella bipunctata</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Ray mentions a locust taken in Spain which emits a yellow
oleaginous fluid from between the claws of its fore
legs<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>; but the precise nature of these substances has
not been ascertained, nor whether they are secreted by
peculiar organs.</p>

<p>vi. <i>Milk.</i> A milky fluid is produced by the larva of
<i>Chrysomela Populi</i>. Willughby observed a similar effusion
from pores in the upper surface of the body of <i>Acilius
sulcatus</i>; and other insects emit it from other parts
of their body<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>.</p>

<p>vii. <i>Honey.</i> It is certain that honey is not an <i>animal</i>
secretion; yet the saccharine matter collected from the
nectaries of flowers, from which it is derived, seems to
undergo some <i>alteration</i> in the stomach; for the consistence
of honey is greater than that of any vegetable
nectar, and its taste does not vary greatly, while that of
the nectar in different plants is probably not the same.
Reaumur also has observed, that each honey-cell in a
bee-hive is always covered by a cream-like layer of a
thicker consistence than the rest, which apparently serves
to prevent the more liquid honey, which from time to
time is introduced under it, from running out<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>. Now
if honey were the unaltered nectar of plants, it is difficult
to conceive how this cream could be collected in
proper proportions. The last-mentioned naturalist likewise
ascertained, that if bees, in a season in which the
fields afford a scarcity of food, be supplied with <i>sugar</i>,
they will from this substance fill their cells with <i>honey</i>
which differs in no respect from the common sort, except
that its flavour is a little heightened<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>:&mdash;a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
argument may be deduced from the circumstance of the
bees imbibing the juices of <i>fruits</i> of various kinds as they
are well known to do<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>. It seems therefore evident that
the honey collected by bees undergoes some modification
in their honey-stomach before it is regurgitated
into the cells, and therefore may be regarded in some
degree as a peculiar secretion.</p>

<p>Huber says that he has ascertained by a great number
of observations that electricity is singularly favourable
to the secretion of the substance of which honey is
formed by flowers; the bees never collect it in greater
abundance, nor is the formation of wax ever more active,
than when the wind is in the south, the air humid and
warm, and a storm gathering<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>.</p>

<p>viii. <i>Wax</i> generally transpires through the pores of
the skin of those insects that produce it, either partially
or generally, and it is secreted from honey or other saccharine
substances taken into the stomach. In the
hive-bee, as has been before stated, it is produced <i>partially</i><a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>,
but in many other insects it is a <i>general</i> transudation
of the body. This is particularly the case with
a large number of the <i>Homopterous Hemiptera</i>; and
those flocoons that look like cotton, and cover the body
of several <i>Chermes</i> and <i>Aphides</i>, if closely examined will
be found of the nature of <i>wax</i>: this I have particularly
noticed with respect to <i>Chermes Fagi</i>, in which the cotton-like
flocoons are often so long as to cause the insect
to look like a feather, and a leaf covered by them exhibits
a very singular appearance, as if clothed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
fine down of a swan<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>. Probably the white powder or
threads that appear to transpire through the skin of
many other insects is of a waxy nature. In the larva of
a beetle described by Reaumur, the flocoons are so arranged
as to give the animal some resemblance to a
hedgehog, and when rubbed off they are reproduced in
twelve hours<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>. Gyllenhal, speaking of <i>Peltis limbata</i>,
observes, that when alive it is covered with a white powder
resembling mould, which if rubbed off returns again
as long as the animal lives<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>.</p>

<p>It will not be improper to include under this head
what further account I have to give of <i>Lac</i>, which though
regarded as a <i>resin</i>, since <i>Cocci</i> sometimes certainly produce
<i>wax</i><a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>, probably has some analogy with the latter
substance. When the females of this <i>Coccus</i> (<i>C. Lacca</i>)
have fixed themselves to a part of the branch of the
trees on which they feed (<i>Ficus religiosa</i> and <i>indica</i>,
<i>Butea frondosa</i>, and <i>Rhamnus Jujuba</i><a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>), a pellucid and
glutinous substance begins to exude from the margins
of the body, and in the end covers the whole insect with
a cell of this substance, which when hardened by exposure
to the air becomes lac. So numerous are these insects,
and so closely crowded together, that they often
entirely cover a branch; and the groups take different
shapes, as squares, hexagons, &amp;c., according to the
space left round the insect which first began to form its
cell. Under these cells the females deposit their eggs,
which after a certain period are hatched, and the young
ones eat their way out. Though indisputably an <i>animal</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
secretion, many of the properties of lac are not very
different from those of the juices of the trees on which
the animal feeds, and which therefore would seem to
undergo but little alteration.</p>

<p>Wax seems also to form a constituent part of some
insects which are not found to secrete it. The yellow
substance deposited in vessels containing <i>spiders</i> in alcohol
is said to be a true <i>wax</i>, and may be obtained from
these animals by gently heating them<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>.</p>

<p>ix. <i>Poisons</i> and <i>Acids</i>. The <i>bite</i> as well as the <i>sting</i>
of many insects is followed by inflamed tumours, so that
the <i>sialisteria</i> of some <i>bugs</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, <i>Aptera</i> and <i>spiders</i>,
may be regarded as producing a poisonous fluid; but
we know nothing of the real nature of it, nor of that of
other venomous insects, except the <i>ant</i>&mdash;whose celebrated
<i>acid</i> may be considered under the present head,&mdash;the
<i>bee</i>, the <i>wasp</i>, and the <i>scorpion</i>.</p>

<p>Contrary to the once received doctrine that no <i>acid</i>
was to be found in any animal, except as the effect of
disease in the alimentary canal, many insects secrete peculiar
and powerful ones. I have on a former occasion
related an instance in which an acid of this description,
secreted in its <i>sialisteria</i>, is employed by a moth to soften
its cocoon<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>; and Lister mentions a species of <i>Iulus</i> which
produced one resembling that of ants<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>; but this last is
the most powerful of all. The fact that blue flowers
when thrown into an ant-hill become tinged with red
has been long known; but Mr. Fisher of Sheffield, about
1670, seems to have been the first who ascertained that
this effect is caused by an <i>acid</i> with which ants abound,
and which may be obtained from them by distillation or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
infusion in water<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>. Margraff and other chemists confirmed
this discovery<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>; and concluding that this acid
was of a peculiar kind, they gave it the name of the <i>Formic
acid</i>. This name, however, is now exploded; the
subsequent experiments of Deyeux, Fourcroy and Vauquelin
having ascertained that the acid of ants is not of
a distinct kind, but a mixture of the <i>Acetic</i> and <i>Malic</i><a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>.
These acids are in such considerable quantities, and so
concentrated in these animals, that, when a number of
<i>Formica rufa</i> are bruised in a mortar, the vapour is so
sharp that it is scarcely possible to endure it at a short
distance. It also transpires from them, for they leave
traces of it on the bodies which they traverse: and hence,
according to the experiments of Mr. Coleridge, the vulgar
notion that ants cannot pass over a line of chalk is
correct; the effervescence produced by the contact of
the acid and alkaline being so considerable, as in some
degree to burn their legs<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>. The circumstance of much
of the food of ants being of a saccharine nature may account
for this copious secretion of acid, the use of which
is probably to defend themselves and their habitations
from the attack and intrusion of their enemies: if a frog
be put into a nest of <i>Formica rufa</i> that has been deranged,
it will be suffocated in five minutes<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>. That which they
<i>ejaculate</i> from their <i>anus</i> when attacked, as formerly
stated<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>, must be secreted in an <i>ioterium</i>; but their very
<i>blood</i> seems of an acid nature. It is very probable, as
Dr. Thomson has observed<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>, that acids may be obtained
from many other insects, and that they are various modifications
of the acetic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>From the circumstance that water is absorbed by
<i>greasy</i> moths, that crystals of a salt are occasionally
found adhering to them, that they change blue litmus
paper <i>red</i>,&mdash;it has been inferred that their supposed <i>oiliness</i>
is in fact an <i>acid</i> or acid salt, having the property
of attracting moisture from the air, the infected moths
being in fact not greasy, but <i>wet</i>; hence the application
of chalk and clay, usually recommended in this case, can
have only a temporary and superficial effect. The only
effectual remedy, is steeping the body in spirits of wine
till all the acid is extracted<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>. This acid is probably the
same as Chaussier obtained from silkworms, since called
<i>Bombic Acid</i><a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>poison</i> of <i>bees</i> and <i>wasps</i>, as to its chemical qualities,
is a transparent fluid, at first sweet to the taste,
but immediately afterwards hot and acrid like the milky
juice of the <i>spurge</i><a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>; soluble in water, but not in alcohol;
and separable from the former in the state of white
powder, when the latter is added giving a slight <i>red</i>
tinge to paper stained with vegetable blue, and when
dry and chewed appearing tenacious, gummy and elastic.
This last property, as well as solubility in water and not
in alcohol, is common also to the poison of the <i>viper</i>,
which however differs in being tasteless, and not affecting
vegetable blues. From hence Fontana concludes
that this fluid is united with an <i>acid</i>, but in a very small
proportion, and not with an <i>alkali</i><a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>. The venom of
bees is extremely active; a grain in weight, it is conjectured,
would kill a pigeon in a few seconds<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
remarkable, however, that while in some constitutions the
sting of a single bee or wasp is sufficient sometimes to
induce alarming symptoms, in others numerous punctures
will produce little or no pain or inflammation. That
this fluid, and not the puncture of the sting, is the sole
cause of the inflammation that usually follows the wound
inflicted by one of these animals, is proved by the facts,
that if it be introduced into one made by a needle, the
same effect ensues, and that when the whole contents of
the poison-bag have been exhausted by the insect's stinging
three or four times in succession, its weapon then
becomes harmless<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>.</p>

<p>The venom of <i>scorpions</i>, though much more potent,
probably resembles that of bees, &amp;c., in many of its
chemical qualities: it issues from two pores in the sting
before described<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>, where, when the animal is irritated,
it accumulates under the form of two little drops of a
whitish colour: spread upon paper this fluid produces
a spot like what would be caused by oil or grease, and
this part of the paper becomes by desiccation firmer and
transparent<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>.</p>

<p>x. <i>Odorous fluids</i> and <i>Vapours</i><a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>. The powerful scents
which different insects emit are extremely numerous,
much more so indeed than the generality of Entomologists
have been aware, for there is scarcely a scent
odious or agreeable that may not be met with in the insect
world. This you will be convinced of, by following a
practice which I would recommend to you&mdash;that of smelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the insects you take. Some of these scents are peculiar
to particular parts or organs, and some are exhaled
generally by the whole body; some are emitted by
a fluid secretion, and others are gaseous effluvia. On
a former occasion I gave you a rather full account of
these scents and their organs<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>; I shall relate here only
what I there omitted. To begin with <i>sweet</i> odours.
Many beetles emit an agreeable scent. The rose-scented
Capricorn or musk-beetle (<i>Cerambyx moschatus</i>) has
long been noted for the delicious scent of roses which it
exhales; this is so powerful as to fill a whole apartment,
and the insect retains it long after its death. Captain
Hancock also informed me that another species of the
same genus, <i>C. sericeus</i>, has in a high degree a scent resembling
that of the cedar<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> on which they feed. Though
most of the micropterous tribes (<i>Brachyptera</i>) have a
<i>fetid</i> smell, yet there are some exceptions to this amongst
them. One species (<i>Philonthus suaveolens</i> K. MS.) related
to <i>P. micans</i>, which I once took, smelt precisely
like a fine high-scented ripe pear; another, <i>Oxytelus
morsitans</i>, like the water-lily; a third, <i>O. rugosus</i>, like
water-cresses; and lastly, a fourth (<i>P. fuscipes</i>) like saffron<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>:
<i>Trichius Eremita</i>, one of the Petalocerous beetles,
is stated to have the scent of Russia leather; <i>Geotrupes
vernalis</i>, in spite of its stercorarious food, of lavender-water<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>.
Mr. Sheppard has observed that <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>
when recently taken smells not unlike liquorice:
Bonnet mentions a caterpillar that had the scent of
new hay. A little gall-fly (<i>Cynips Quercus Ramuli</i>) has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the remarkable odour of Fraxinella: the larva of another
species of this genus (<i>C. Rosæ</i>) has an odour which
seemed to Reaumur as attractive to cats as that of <i>Nepeta
cataria</i> or <i>Teucrium Marum</i><a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>: some <i>Phalangia</i>
smell like walnut leaves<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>; and the various species of the
genus <i>Prosopis</i> (<i>Melitta</i> * b. K.) have a very agreeable
scent of <i>Dracocephalum moldavicum</i><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>.</p>

<p>We next come to <i>fetid</i> odours. These in numerous
cases are known to be secreted and emitted by appropriate
vessels and organs; they are often exhaled
from a fluid secretion, of which, in the letter lately referred
to, I gave you almost all the known instances.
Savi, in his history of <i>Iulus f&#339;tidissimus</i>, informs us that
it emits a yellow fetid fluid from its supposed spiracles,
which if applied in sufficient quantity imparts a red colour
to the skin, to be removed neither by friction nor
washing, but only disappearing by time; when removed
from the black vesicles in which it is stored, it shoots
into very transparent octahedral crystals<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>.</p>

<p>I have before mentioned the coloured fluid which
some insects emit when they are disclosed from the
pupa, and that it probably exhales some powerful odour
which attracts the males<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>.</p>

<p>The great <i>Hydrophilus</i>, in its larva state, when first
taken into the hand remains without motion; in a minute
afterwards it renders itself so flaccid as to appear
like a cast skin. Taken by the tail it contracts itself
considerably, it then agitates itself briskly, and ejaculates
with a slight noise a fetid and blackish fluid<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>In other cases these odours are produced by <i>gaseous
vapours</i>. That of the Bombardiers (<i>Brachinus</i>) is the
most celebrated and remarkable. It is whitish, of a
powerful and stimulating odour, very like that exhaled
by nitrous acid. It is caustic, producing upon the skin
the sensation of burning, and forming instantly upon it
red spots which soon turn brown, and which, in spite of
frequent lotions, remain several days. It turns blue
paper red<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>. That amiable, intelligent, and unfortunate
traveller Mr. Ritchie,&mdash;whose premature death, when attempting
to penetrate to the interior of Africa, all lovers
of Natural History so deeply lamented, and whose ardour
in the pursuit of that science I had an opportunity of
witnessing, when, in company with him, Messrs. Savigny,
Du Fresne, and W. S. MacLeay in 1817, I visited the
forest of Fontainebleau,&mdash;in a letter to the last-mentioned
gentleman<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>, relates that his companion M. Dupont, near
Tripoli took a nest consisting of more than a thousand
of a species of this genus. "I am making a few experiments,"
says he, "on the substance which they emit
when they crepitate, but do not know whether I can collect
enough to arrive at any conclusion. It made Dupont's
fingers entirely black when he took them. It is
neither alkaline nor acid, and it is soluble in water and
in alcohol." From this we may conjecture that it formed
crystals.</p>

<p>xi. <i>Phosphorus.</i> On this remarkable secretion I have
so fully enlarged on a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>, that here I shall
merely add a few observations which Mr. Murray obligingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
communicated to me. He remarks that in a box
in which glow-worms were kept&mdash;five luminous specks
were found secreted by the animal, which seemed to glow
and were of a different tinge of light. One put into olive
oil at eleven <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> continued to yield a steady and uninterrupted
light until five o'clock the following morning,
and then seemed, like the stars, to be only absorbed by
superior effulgence. The luminous spherical matter of
the glow-worm is evidently enveloped in a sac or capsule
perfectly diaphanous, which when ruptured discloses it
in a liquid form, of the consistency of cream. M. Macaire,
he observes, in the <i>Bibliothèque Universelle</i>, draws
the following conclusions from experiments made on the
luminous matter of this animal;&mdash;that a <i>certain</i> degree
of heat is necessary to their voluntary phosphorescence&mdash;that
it is excited by a degree of heat superior to the
first, and inevitably destroyed by a higher&mdash;that bodies
which coagulate albumen take away the power&mdash;that
phosphorescence cannot take place but in a gas containing
no oxygen&mdash;that it is not excited by common electricity,
but is so by the Voltaic pile&mdash;and lastly, that
the matter is chiefly composed of <i>albumen</i>.</p>

<p>xii. <i>Fat.</i> There is one product found in the body of insects
most copiously in their larva state, but more or less
also in the imago, which may be called their <i>fat</i>. In the
former it is a many-lobed mass, occupying the whole of
the interior, except the space that is required for the
muscles and the internal organs, which it wraps round
and protects. It is contained in floating membranes,
very numerous, which fill all the interstices, and assume
the appearance sometimes of small globules, and sometimes
of a thickish mucilage, which easily melts and inflames;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in colour it is most commonly white, but sometimes
yellow or green. It is imagined to be a kind of
<i>epiploon</i> or <i>caul</i>, and is accumulated in the <i>larva</i> as a
store of nutriment for the growth and development of the
organs of the perfect insect while in the <i>pupa</i> state<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>.
The blood in which the different organs float that is
not required for their nutriment, is supposed to be expended
in the formation of this substance. Marcel de
Serres is of opinion that it is secreted from the chyle by
passing through the pores of the dorsal vessel, formerly
called the heart of insects<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>.</p>

<p>Under this head I may mention what little is known
with regard to the <i>perspiration</i> of these animals<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>. That
a considerable quantity of fluid passes off from them
when in the pupa state, is sufficiently proved by the loss
of weight which they undergo, and by the experiments
of Reaumur, who collected the fluid in closed glass
tubes; and that in their perfect state they are constantly
passing off perspirable matter by the pores of their skin
or crust, is not only rendered probable by the succulent
nature of their food and the absence of any urinary discharge,
but is proved by what takes place in a swarm of
bees. These insects, when crowded together in hot
weather in a large mass, become heated to such a degree,
and perspire so copiously, that those near the bottom
are quite drenched with the moisture it produces, which
so relaxes their wings that they are unable to fly<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>.</p>

<h5>REPRODUCTION.</h5>


<p>The reproductive organs of insects in their <i>general</i> denominations
and functions correspond with those of the
higher classes of animals; but as to <i>number</i>, <i>proportions</i>,
and other <i>particular</i> details of their structure, they differ
from them very considerably. I shall not now, however,
enter at large upon this subject, but confine myself principally
to the consideration of those organs in the female
which are appropriated to the formation, fecundation,
maturation, exclusion and deposition of their eggs, and
other circumstances relating to that subject. The organs
connected with this function are the <i>Sperm-reservoir</i>;
the <i>Oviduct</i>; the <i>Ovaries</i>; and the <i>Ovipositor</i>.</p>

<p>I. The Sperm-reservoir (<i>Spermatheca</i>) is an organ connecting
the vagina with the oviduct, which, according to
Herold, receives the male sperm as into a reservoir<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>, and
fecundates the eggs in their transit through that passage.
This vessel, which consists of a double tunic, in the cabbage-butterfly
terminates the vagina, and is connected
with the oviduct by a lateral undulating tube: in shape
it is a rather irregular oblong, and is surmounted by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
small orbicular vesicle, connected by a short tubular footstalk
with the main reservoir<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>. A similar organ was discovered
by Malpighi in the imago of the silkworm, who
denominates it the <i>uterus</i>; to which indeed it seems analogous,
and which he also regards as a reservoir for the
sperm for the gradual fecundation of the eggs<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>. But in
that fly the organ is of a rather different shape, and the
interior vessel terminates in several spherical vesicles<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>.
John Hunter by the most decisive experiments, such as
covering the eggs of the unimpregnated moth, after exclusion,
with the liquor taken from the spermatheca in
those which had been impregnated, and rendering them
fertile, he demonstrated that this organ was a reservoir for
the spermatic fluid, to impregnate the eggs as they were
ready for exclusion, and that coition and impregnation
were not simultaneous<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>. It is not improbable that in
all insects whose eggs are gradually laid, this provision
for their gradual fecundation, if carefully sought for,
might be detected<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>. Rifferschweils is of opinion, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in these cases the eggs are fertilized in their transit
through the oviduct by sperm adhering to the folds of
the <i>cloacæ</i><a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>: but this opinion seems less analogous to
what takes place in other cases, with regard to the due
preparation of the eggs for a safe and effectual transit<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>.</p>

<p>II. The Oviduct (<i>Oviductus</i>) is the canal, always separate
from the vagina, which receives the eggs from the
ovary, transmitting them, often by a peculiar and complex
instrument in which it terminates, to their proper
station. This canal sometimes opens into the anal passage
or <i>cloaca</i>, and at others, as in the cabbage-butterfly<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>,
is distinct, and lies between the sexual organ and the
anus. In the <i>Arachnida</i> there are <i>two</i> oviducts<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>.</p>

<p>III. The Ovaries (<i>Ovaria</i>) in insects are the viscera
in which the eggs are generated and grow till they arrive
at maturity, when they pass through the oviduct,
and are extruded or deposited in their appropriate station.
They vary considerably in their structure. In all
however, except the <i>Iulidæ</i>, in which there is only a
<i>single</i> ovary<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>, the oviduct at its upper or inner extremity
terminates in <i>two</i> branches, usually further subdivided
into a number of smaller conical ones, which several ramifications
constitute the <i>ovaries</i>, or egg-tubes as they
are sometimes called: these tubes generally consist of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
single membrane, and are joined to the oviduct by membranous
rugose <i>cloacæ</i><a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>: in the <i>Phalangia</i>, however,
there are <i>two</i> tunics; the outer one of a cellular substance,
and the inner one consisting of spiral fibres like <i>tracheæ</i>&mdash;a
kind of structure which renders them capable of great
extension<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>. Rifferschweils considers the ovaries as formed
upon <i>two</i> primary types.&mdash;<i>First</i>, <i>flagelliform</i> ovaries,
consisting of conical tubes equal in length, and inserted
at the same place at the end of the primary branches as
in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the Bee, &amp;c. <i>Secondly</i>, <i>racemose</i>
ovaries, consisting of short conical tubes, so proceeding
from the primary branches as to render the ovary racemose
or pinnated, as in certain <i>Neuroptera</i>, <i>Coleoptera</i>,
and <i>Diptera</i><a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>: but perhaps their structure will be better
understood if they are divided into <i>agglomerate</i> ovaries
and <i>branching</i> ovaries: in the <i>first</i> the egg-tubes form
<i>two</i> bundles, in which the branches are not discernible,
as in the <i>Ephemera</i>, the chamæleon-fly, and spiders<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>:
and in the <i>second</i> the branches are distinct, as in the
<i>Lepidoptera</i> and the majority of insects.</p>

<p>The number of branches varies in different genera and
species. In <i>Echinomyia grossa</i>, a large fly, there are
only the <i>two</i> primary branches<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>; in the common dung-beetle
(<i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>) these appear divided at
their apex into fingers<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>: in <i>Scolia</i>, a Hymenopterous
genus, and the butterfly of the nettle, there are <i>three</i>
secondary branches on each side<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>: in many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
<i>Lepidoptera</i> and the humble-bee there are <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>; in the
common louse there are <i>five</i><a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>; in the rhinoceros-beetle
and the cockchafer, <i>six</i><a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>; in the wasp, <i>seven</i><a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>; <i>eight</i> in
the cockroach<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>; <i>twelve</i> in the <i>Carabi</i> and the mealworm-beetle<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>;
<i>thirty</i> in the large green grasshopper (<i>Acrida
viridissima</i><a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>); <i>thirty-two</i> in the cheese-maggot-fly<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>; and
in the hive-bee more than <i>a hundred and fifty</i><a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>.</p>

<p>The number of <i>eggs</i> also contained in the ovaries
varies. In <i>Echinomyia grossa</i> there is only <i>one</i> egg in
each, and only <i>two</i> at once in the matrix<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>: in another
fly produced by the cheese-maggot there are <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>; in
the louse there are <i>five</i>; in the cockchafer <i>six</i><a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>; in the
hive-bee <i>sixteen</i> or <i>seventeen</i> are visible at the same time<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>;
and in the silkworm-moth <i>sixty</i> or <i>seventy</i><a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>. Besides
the eggs, the tubes contain a pellucid mucus, and at
their upper extremity the eggs are lost in a granular
mucous mass, in which, however, they may still be discovered
with a microscope<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>. With regard to the termination
of the ovaries or egg-tubes internally,&mdash;in those
that have agglomerated ones it is not to be traced, the
whole appearing like an oblong obtuse or acute body<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>:
but in the branching ones it is more easily traced; at
first they converge in most cases to a point; this is seen
to advantage in the caterpillar of some butterflies, when
near assuming the pupa, in which they are readily discovered,
and represent with great truth and elegance the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
bud of some blossom<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>; but in time they diverge, and
sometimes become convoluted<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>; they generally terminate
in a slender simple filament, but in the louse in a
fork<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>; they are sometimes extremely long, as in the
wasp and <i>Lepidoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>; in the hive-bee they appear to
be shorter<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>.</p>

<p>IV. We are next to consider the <i>Ovipositor</i>, or instrument
by which numerous insects are enabled to introduce
their eggs into their appropriate situations, and
where the new-born larva may immediately meet with
its destined food. As this instrument is one of the most
striking peculiarities with which the wisdom of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>
has gifted these little animals, and in many cases is
extremely curious and wonderful, both in its structure
and modes of operation&mdash;though on a former occasion I
gave you a brief account of several kinds of them<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>, I
shall now enter more at large into the subject, and describe
these often complex machines, as they are exhibited
in most of the different Orders of insects.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order, there are doubtless
numerous variations in the structure of this organ;
but very few have been noticed, and those chiefly belong
to insects whose grubs feed on timber. In these it is
usually retractile one part within another, like the pieces
of a telescope: in <i>Buprestis</i> it consists of three long
and sharp <i>laminæ</i>, the two lateral ones forming a sheath to
the intermediate one, which probably conveys the eggs<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>:
in <i>Elater</i> it is a cylindrical organ, terminating in a pair
of conical joints, which seem to form a forceps, and including
a tube probably conveying the egg to the forceps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
which perhaps introduces it<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>. The Ovipositor of
<i>Prionus coriarius</i> differs from that of <i>Callidium violaceum</i>,
and many Capricorns before described<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>: it consists
merely of a long bivalve piece ending in a kind of forceps,
and hollowed above into a channel for the passage
of the eggs<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Orthoptera</i> the instrument of oviposition is
more simple; in <i>Locusta</i> consisting merely of four robust
three-sided pieces, two above and two below, the
former pair at the end curving upwards and the latter
downwards<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>, these pieces seem calculated when they
have entered the earth to enlarge the burrow, and the
animal appears able to separate them very widely from
each other<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>. The ovipositor of <i>Acrida viridissima</i>, which
like that of many Hymenopterous insects forms a kind
of appendage or tail to the body, has been described
both by De Geer and Latreille as consisting of <i>two</i> valves
only<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>; but in reality it consists of <i>six</i>, two upper and
four lower, as you may ascertain by means of a pin or
the point of a penknife, which will readily separate them.
This is confirmed by a figure of Stoll's of a species which
seems to connect <i>Conocephalus</i> with <i>Gryllus</i>. In this
the ovipositor is considerably longer than the body of
the animal, and is composed of <i>six</i> distinct pieces; viz.
<i>two</i> external ones stouter than the rest, and within these
<i>four</i> others finer than a hair and convolute at the apex<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>.
There is a considerable variety in the shape of the ovipositors
of the <i>Acridæ</i> and the cognate genera:&mdash;thus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
<i>A. viridissima</i> this organ is straight, in <i>A. verrucivora</i>
bent like a sabre, and in <i>Pterophylla citrifolia</i> and some
others, the whole machine is short and boat-shaped; in
<i>Scaphura Vigorsii</i> it is also rough with sharp little tubercles<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>.
I had an opportunity of observing, with respect
to the first of these insects, that in boring, as is the case
with the <i>Cicadæ</i> and saw-flies, the motion of the valves
was alternately backwards and forwards. It appeared
also to me that the two outer pieces of each of the apparent
valves were fixed in a groove in the margin of
the intermediate one. I saw this clearly with respect to
the <i>upper</i> pieces, and it is most probable that the lower
are similarly circumstanced. In the cricket tribe (<i>Gryllus</i>)
the ovipositor is as long as the abdomen, very slender,
terminating in a knob<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>. It is <i>apparently</i> bivalve like
that of <i>Acrida</i>, but I believe is resolvable into the same
number of pieces.</p>

<p>In the <i>Homopterous Hemiptera</i> there seems to be more
than one type on which the ovipositor is constructed. In
an insect very common with us, the froth froghopper
(<i>Cercopis spumaria</i>), some approach is made to the ovipositors
last described, at least the number of pieces is
the same&mdash;for it has a pair of external valves forming a
sheath, which includes three sharp <i>laminæ</i> resembling
the blades of a lancet, the middle one of which can be separated
into two; this instrument De Geer had reason
to think was scored transversely like a file<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>. In the insects
of this Order so noted for their song<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> (<i>Cicada</i>),
there are only <i>five</i> pieces; namely, two valves forming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
sheath, two augers or borers, and an intermediate piece
upon which they slide, each being furnished with an
internal groove for that purpose, and the middle piece
with a ridge to fit; a contrivance of Divine Wisdom,
to prevent their dislocation when employed in boring;
the augers terminate in a knob which is externally
toothed<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>. This structure approaches that of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
especially the saw-flies. With regard to
the <i>Heteropterous</i> section of this Order&mdash;as they usually
do not introduce their eggs <i>into</i> any substance, they have
no call for any remarkable ovipositor, and therefore are
not so furnished. A remark which will also apply to
the <i>Lepidoptera</i> Order.</p>

<p>In the <i>Libellulina</i> amongst the <i>Neuroptera</i>, an organ
of this kind is sometimes discoverable. In <i>Agrion</i>, Reaumur
noticed a part which he conjectured to be an <i>ovipositor</i>;
it consists of four <i>laminæ</i> or lancets, the interior
pair slender, the exterior wider, and all externally serrated<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>.</p>

<p>The insects of the <i>Hymenoptera</i> Order have long been
celebrated for the organs we are describing, whether
used as <i>saws</i>, <i>augers</i>, or <i>darts</i>. I formerly gave you a
very <i>general</i> account of the <i>saws</i>,&mdash;I shall now give you
a very interesting one in <i>detail</i> copied from an admirable
little essay of Professor Peck. "This instrument,"
says he, "is a very curious object; and in order
to describe it it will be proper to compare it with the
<i>tenon-saw</i> used by cabinet-makers, which being made
of a very thin plate of steel, is fitted with a back to prevent
its bending. The back is a piece of iron, in which
a narrow and deep groove is cut to receive the plate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
which is fixed: the saw of the <i>Tenthredo</i> is also furnished
with a back, but the groove is in the plate, and receives
a prominent ridge of the back, which is not fixed, but
permits the saw to slide forward and backward as it is
thrown out or retracted. The saw of artificers is <i>single</i>,
but that of the <i>Tenthredo</i> is <i>double</i>, and consists of two
distinct saws with their backs: the insect in using them,
first throws out one, and while it is returning pushes forward
the other; and this alternate motion is continued
till the incision is effected, when the two saws receding
from each other, conduct the egg between them into
its place. In the artificial saw the teeth are alternately
bent toward the sides, or out of the right line, in order
that the fissure or kerf may be made sufficiently wide
for the blade to move easily. To answer this purpose
in some measure, in that of the <i>Tenthredo</i> the teeth are
a little twisted, so as to stand obliquely with respect to
the right line, and their point of course projects a little
beyond the plane of the blade, without being laterally
bent; and all those in each blade thus project a little
outwards: but the kerf is more effectually made, and a
free range procured for the saws, by small teeth placed
on the outer side of each; so that while their vertical
effect is that of a <i>saw</i>, their lateral effect is that of a <i>rasp</i>.
In the artificial saw the teeth all point outward (<i>towards
the end</i>) and are simple; but in the saw of the <i>Tenthredo</i>
they point inward, or toward the handle, and their outer
edge is beset with smaller teeth which point outwards
(<i>towards the end</i>)<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>." Valisnieri, Reaumur, and De Geer
describe the groove as being in the back; but in Mr.
Peck's insect, if there is no error in his account, it is, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
in the <i>Cicadæ</i>, in the saw itself<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>. In the genus <i>Cimbex</i>,
belonging to the same tribe, the saw differs in shape,
being somewhat <i>sigmoidal</i> or resembling the letter S,
while in that of other saw-flies it is <i>cultriform</i> with a concave
edge: other minor differences distinguish them,
which need not be particularized.</p>

<p>A similar structure, with regard to the organ in question,
obtains in the rest of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, even those
that use it as a weapon of offence; but the backs of the
saws in them, composed of a single piece, become a
sheath for the darts. The valves, however, vary. In most
of those with an exerted sting, as <i>Pimpla</i>, they are linear,
exerted, and as long as the aculeus itself<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>. In <i>Proctotrupes</i>
they appear to be united so as to form a tube for
the ovipositor, and are produced by a prolongation of
the last abdominal segment. The darts usually run in
two grooves of the sheath, and at their apex are retroserrulate<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>.
In some cases the sheath itself is serrated<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>.
The shanks of the darts are connected with the valves;
so that when these open they are pushed out: sometimes
on their outer side they have a triangular plate towards
the base, which prevents their being pushed out too far<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>.</p>

<p>In <i>Sirex</i> and many ichneumons, in which the ovipositor
is too long to be withdrawn within the abdomen, it
remains always exerted; but in general it is retracted
within that part when unemployed. In the gall-fly (<i>Cynips</i>)
this instrument is really as long as in <i>Pimpla</i>, &amp;c.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
but as it is infinitely more slender, when in repose it is
rolled up spirally and concealed within the abdomen.
It is the puncture of this minute organ that produces the
curious galls formerly described to you<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>. But the most
anomalous ovipositor in this Order appears to be that
of <i>Chrysis</i> (<i>C. ignita</i>, &amp;c.), which is covered by several
demi-tubes or scales enveloping and sliding over each
other: when these scales are removed, the true ovipositor
appears, which is of a structure similar to that of the rest
of the Order, but the valves are long and slender with
their summit generally visible without the anus<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>.</p>

<p>Though the ovipositor of the majority of <i>Dipterous</i> insects
is a tube with retractile joints<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>, in the crane-flies
this organ is different, and, like that of <i>Acrida</i> above described,
consists of what at first sight appear two valves,
but each of which is formed of two pieces, the upper
ones sharp and longer, and the lower pair blunt. The
upper pair forms the auger that bores a hole in the
ground, and the lower conducts the eggs into it after it
is bored<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Aptera</i> and <i>Arachnida</i> in general there seems
no remarkable instrument of this kind; but Treviranus
has described one in spiders for extruding the eggs of a
singular construction. It is an oval plate lying between
the external genitals and spinning organs, and is composed
of a number of small screw-shaped cartilages, connected
together in the most wonderful manner. There
are few organs, he observes, in the animal kingdom which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
for their artificial mechanism can be compared with this.
Each cartilage inosculates very closely in the adjoining
one, and all are besides bound together by a strong skin<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>.</p>

<p>The manner in which the eggs of insects are <i>fecundated</i>
by the male sperm is one of those mysteries of Nature
that are not yet fully elucidated and understood. We
can readily conceive that all the eggs may be fertilized
by a single intercourse in the case of insects which, like
the <i>Ephemeræ</i> and <i>Trichoptera</i>, exclude the whole mass
at once; or like many moths and butterflies, in a very
short time afterwards; but the subject becomes much
more difficult to explain when we advert to the female
of the hive-bee, the whole number of whose eggs, deposited
in <i>two years</i>, are, as Huber has demonstrated,
in like manner fertilized by a single act<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>:&mdash;if you bear
in mind, however, what I have lately observed with regard
to Malpighi's discovery of a sperm-reservoir in
insects, you will more readily comprehend how in this
case a <i>gradual</i> fecundation may take place. The principal
objection to this solution of the difficulty in the case
before us, is derived from the very small size of the organ
supposed to be destined for this purpose&mdash;it being
scarcely bigger than the head of a pin<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>: it seems therefore
incredible that it should retain any portion of an
extraneous fluid at the end of twelve or eighteen months,
and still more unlikely that the fluid should in the interval
have sufficed for the slightest moistening of not
fewer than 30,000 or 40,000 eggs. The only hypothesis
that seems at all to square with this fact, is that of Dr.
Haighton,&mdash;that impregnation is the result not of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
actual contact of the sperm with the eggs, but of some unknown
sympathetic influence<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>, or rather perhaps of some
penetrating effluvia or <i>aura seminalis</i>, which, though
small in quantity, it may retain the power of emitting for
a long period.</p>

<p>Certain female moths, of the species of that family
which, from the remarkable cases or sacs the larvæ inhabit,
the Germans call <i>sack&mdash;träger</i>, before noticed<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>,
have been supposed to have the faculty of producing fertile
eggs without any sexual intercourse; and various
observers, after taking great pains, appeared to have satisfactorily
proved the fact; so that some doubted whether
these insects produced any males at all<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>. The enigma
was at length explained by the accurate Von Scheven.
At first his experiments were attended with the same result
as those of his predecessors; but upon making them
more carefully, and separating what he conceived to be
the female from the male pupæ, he ascertained not only
the existence of a <i>female</i> in the species he examined
(<i>Psyche vestita</i>), but that when thus secluded she laid
<i>barren</i> eggs; evidently proving that in the contrary instances
above alluded to, an unperceived sexual intercourse
must have taken place<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>. Though he thus ascertained
that these insects do not in this respect deviate
from the general rule, he remarked or confirmed several
facts in their economy sufficiently anomalous and striking;&mdash;as
that the female is not only without wings, but
with scarcely any feature of a <i>moth</i>, much more closely
resembling a <i>caterpillar</i>; and that in ordinary circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
she never attempts to leave the pupa-case in
which she has been disclosed, but that being there impregnated
by the male, she there also, apparently after
the manner of the female <i>Cocci</i>, deposits her eggs, which
hatching produce young larvæ that make their way out
of the case, and thus seem to originate without maternal
interference<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable fact bearing upon this head,
though as relating to a <i>viviparous</i> insect it does not
strictly belong to it, is the impregnation of the female
<i>Aphides</i>, or plant-lice, before alluded to<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>. If you take a
young female <i>Aphis</i> at the moment of its birth, and rigorously
seclude it from all intercourse with its kind,
only providing it with proper food, it will produce a
brood of young ones: and not only this; but if one of
these be treated in the same way, a similar result will
ensue, and so on, at least to the <i>fifth</i> generation!! to
which period Bonnet, who first made an accurate series
of observations on this almost miraculous fact, successfully
carried his experiments, till the approach of winter
and the want of proper food forced him to desist<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>; and
Lyonet extended it still further<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>. It is now generally
admitted as an incontestible fact, that female <i>Aphides</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
have the faculty of giving birth to young ones without
having had any intercourse with the other sex. How
are we to explain this most extraordinary fact? Are
we to suppose with Bonnet that these insects are truly
androgynous, as strictly uniting both sexes in one? This
supposition, however, is completely overturned by the
circumstance, that there are actually <i>male</i> as well as
<i>female Aphides</i>, and that these, as was first observed
by Lyonet, are united towards the close of the summer
in the usual manner<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>. The most likely supposition
therefore is, that one conjunction of the sexes suffices
for the impregnation of all the females that in a succession
of generations spring from that union. It is true
that at the first view this supposition appears incredible,
contradicting the general laws and course of nature in
the production of animals. But the case of the hive-bee,
stated above, in which a single intercourse with the
male fertilizes all the eggs that are laid for the space of
<i>two</i> years, and in the case of a common spider mentioned
by Audebert<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>, for <i>many</i> years, shows that the
sperm preserves its vivifying powers unimpaired for a
long period, indeed a longer period than is requisite for
the impregnation of all the broods that a female Aphis
can produce; and if immediate contact with the fluid be
not necessary, who can say that this is impossible? It
is, however, one of those mysteries of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span> that
human intellect cannot fully penetrate. But this anomaly
in nature is not wholly confined to the Aphides; since
Jurine has ascertained that the same thing takes place
with <i>Daphnia pennata</i> Müll (<i>Monoculus Pulex</i> L.), one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of Branchiopod <i>Crustacea</i><a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>. It is worth observing
whether the female <i>Aphides</i> in their natural state, I mean
those of the summer or viviparous broods, have intercourse
with the male. I think I have noticed males
amongst them; but they seem to become most numerous
in the autumn, preparatory to the impregnation of
the oviparous females. The object of this law of the
<span class="smcap">Creator</span> is probably the more ready multiplication of
the species<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As to the period of <i>gestation</i>, most insects begin to lay
their eggs soon after fecundation has taken place: but
in some <i>Arachnida</i>, as the Scorpion, which seems to be
both oviparous and ovo-viviparous, nearly a year intervenes,
and the eggs increase to <i>four</i> times the size which
they had attained at that period, before they are extruded<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>.
The time that is required to lay the whole
they are to produce, varies also in <i>insects</i>. In this respect
they may be divided into two great classes:&mdash;those
namely which deposit the whole at <i>once</i>, as <i>Ephemerina</i>,
<i>Trichoptera</i>, &amp;c., and those which deposit them in <i>succession</i>,
occupying in this operation a longer or shorter
period. Many in the <i>first</i> class, as the <i>Trichoptera</i> or
caseworm-flies, envelope their eggs in a gelatinous substance<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>,
which renders their extrusion in a mass more
easy. Of the <i>second</i> class, which includes by far the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
greater proportion of insects, some exclude the whole
number in a very short period, others require two or
three days or a week, as the cockroach<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>; and others, as
the queen-bee, not less than two years. The eggs in the
ovaries of the last vary infinitely in size; those that have
entered the oviduct have arrived at maturity, while the
rest grow gradually smaller as they approach the capillary
extremity of the tubes, where they become at length
invisible to the highest magnifier<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>. In many insects
the eggs seem nearly to have reached their full growth
previously to the exclusion of the female from the pupa;
and this exclusion and the impregnation and laying of
the eggs rapidly succeed each other. One moth (<i>Hypogymna
dispar</i>), which is remarkable for the number
of eggs she contains, sometimes deposits them, even before
they are fecundated, in the pupa-case<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>. But in
other cases the sexual union is not so immediate, and
some time, longer or shorter, is requisite for the due expansion
of the eggs; and the ovaries of the animal swell
so much, as often to enlarge the abdomen to an extraordinary
bulk: this is seen in a very common beetle (<i>Chrysomela
Polygoni</i>) that feeds upon the knot-grass; but in
no insect is it so striking as in the female of the white
ants, whose wonderful increase of size after impregnation
I have related to you on a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I shall conclude this subject with a few observations upon
<i>ovo-viviparous insects</i>; <i>supposed neuters</i>, and <i>hybrids</i>, which,
though they do not fall in regularly under any of the foregoing
heads, may very well have a place in this letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>1. It has already been observed that there are a few
<i>ovo-viviparous</i> insects<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>, the young of which exist in the
ovaries at first as eggs, but are hatched within the body
of the mother, and come forth in the living form of a
larva and sometimes even of a pupa. Of the first description
are certain <i>Diptera</i>, the <i>Aphides</i>, and the <i>Scorpion</i>.</p>

<p>Reaumur has described two modes in which the larvæ
of the first are arranged in the matrix of the mother.
In some they are heaped together without much appearance
of order, being placed merely parallel to each
other<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>; but in others they are arranged in a kind of riband&mdash;the
length of the little animals, which are also
parallel, forming its thickness&mdash;rolled up like the mainspring
of a watch<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>. These larvæ in general are not divided
into <i>two</i> masses corresponding with the pair of
ovaries in other insects, but form only a single one<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>.
You must not suppose that these little fetuses lie naked
in the womb of the mother; each has its own envelope
formed of the finest membrane, which, however, is not
entirely divided from that of those adjoining to it, but
appears to be one tube, which becomes extremely slender
between each individual, so as when drawn out to
look like a chain<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>. Reaumur seems to have thought
that in these flies the larvæ were never confined in any
other case or egg<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>; but De Geer sometimes found <i>eggs</i>
in the body of <i>Sarcophaga carnaria</i>, though most generally
larvæ, from which he conjectures that it is really
<i>ovo-viviparous</i>, the eggs being hatched in the body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the mother<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>. As these flies are all carnivorous, and
their office is to remove putrescent flesh, you may see at
one glance the object of <span class="smcap">Providence</span> in this law of
nature&mdash;that no time may be lost, and the animal exercise
its function as soon as it is disclosed from the
matrix.</p>

<p>The <i>Aphides</i>, so fruitful in singular anomalies, are
ovo-viviparous, as I have before hinted<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>, at one period
of the year, that is during the summer, but strictly oviparous
at its close. From the experiments of De Geer,
however, upon <i>Aphis Rosæ</i>, it would appear that this
faculty is not conferred upon the <i>same</i> individuals, but
only upon those of <i>different</i> generations of the same
species; all the generations being ovo-viviparous except
the <i>last</i>, which is oviparous<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>: nor does it appear, as
has been sometimes imagined, that it is common to the
whole genus. De Geer observed a species in the fir,
which makes curious galls resembling a fir cone (<i>Aphis
Abietis</i>), which appeared never to be ovo-viviparous<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>scorpions</i>, it does not seem clear that
they are <i>always</i> ovo-viviparous: M. Dufour twice found
in the midst of the eggs nearly mature, a young scorpion
which appeared to him at large in the cavity of the abdomen;
it was so large that it was difficult to comprehend
how it could possibly be excluded from the animal, without
an extraordinary operation<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>. The <i>pupiparous</i> insects
(<i>Hippobosca</i>, &amp;c.) have been sufficiently noticed before<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>.</p>

<p>2. I have already in several of my former letters stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
to you what the modern doctrine of physiologists is with
respect to certain individuals, usually forming the most
numerous part of the community with insects living in
society, that were formerly supposed to be <i>neuters</i>, or as
to their sex neither male nor female&mdash;that they are in
almost every instance a kind of abortive females, fed with
a different and less stimulating food than that appropriated
to those whose ovaries are to be developed, and in
consequence in most instances incapable of conception<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>.
Upon these sterile females, you also heard, devolve in
general the principal labours of their respective colonies,
showing the beneficent design of <span class="smcap">Providence</span> in exempting
them from sexual cares and desires, and meriting for
them the more appropriate name, now generally used, of
<i>workers</i>. The differences in the structure of the female
bee and the workers were also then accounted for; and
similar reasoning may be had recourse to with regard to
those of ants, in which the worker and the female differ
still more materially. My reason for introducing this
subject here, is to observe to you that I have some
grounds for thinking that this system extends further
than is usually supposed, and that to each species in
some <i>Coleopterous</i> and other genera there are certain
individuals intermediate between the male and female;
this I seem to have observed more especially in <i>Copris</i>
and <i>Onthophagus</i>. For in almost every British species
in my cabinet of these genera I possess such an individual,
distinguished particularly by having a horn on the
head longer than that of the female, but much shorter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
than that of the male. I once observed a pair of <i>Pentatoma
oleracea</i>, a very pretty bug, <i>in coitu</i>, both sexes
being ornamented with <i>white</i> spots, and by them stood
a third distinguished from them by <i>red</i> ones. I do not,
however, build on this circumstance, though singular;
but mention it merely that you may keep it in your eye.
It would be curious should it turn up, that, to answer
some particular end of <span class="smcap">Providence</span>, in some tribes of
insects there are two kinds of <i>males</i>, as in the gregarious
ones two descriptions of <i>females</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XLIII" id="LETTER_XLIII">LETTER XLIII.</a></h2>

<h3><i>INTERNAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
OF INSECTS, CONCLUDED.</i></h3>

<h5>MOTION.</h5>


<p>We have seen upon a former occasion the great variety
of movements that insects can perform, and of the <i>external</i>
organs with which they perform them<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>: but we
are now to consider the <i>internal</i> apparatus, by the immediate
action of which they take place&mdash;their system of
<i>muscles</i>. When we reflect upon the wonderful velocity,
their size considered, with which many insects move, and
the unparalleled degree of muscular force that many exert<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>,
we feel no small degree of curiosity to know something
of that part of their internal structure that produces
these almost incredible effects. I shall in the
present letter endeavour in some degree to gratify that
curiosity, and give you an account of the <i>muscles</i> of these
little animals,&mdash;first considering them in <i>general</i>; and
then, as far as my information goes, adverting to those
in <i>particular</i> that move the different parts and organs of
an insect's body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>I. The muscles of insects may be considered in general
as to their <i>Origin</i>; <i>Substance</i> and <i>Parts</i>; <i>Shape</i>; <i>Colour</i>;
<i>Kinds</i>; <i>Attachment</i>; and <i>Motions</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Origin.</i> The origin of the muscular fibre in the
higher animals is from the <i>blood</i>, the globules of which,
by their coagulation in a <i>series</i>, appear to form it<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>; and
in insects it is derived from the same universal source of
nutrition and accretion, but not till it has been concreted
into the adipose tissue or <i>epiploon</i> before noticed<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>. In
the pupa of the cabbage-butterfly, Herold observed that
this substance first assumed a fine flocky appearance and
a blue-green colour, and that from it so changed were
produced tender bundles of muscular fibres, extending
in various directions, the epiploon itself decreasing in
proportion as they were formed<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Substance</i> and <i>Parts</i>. The muscular fibre in vertebrate
animals appears to consist of globules arranged
in a series, and of no larger diameter than those of the
blood,&mdash;the mean diameter of which in the human subject,
when measured under the microscope by a micrometer,
is found to be about <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5000</sub></small>th part of an inch<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>. When
Cuvier published his immortal work in 1805, the powers
of any magnifier then constructed were not sufficient to
enable this great physiologist to arrive at the simple
fibre<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>; but Mr. Bauer, by the use of improved glasses,
amongst other discoveries that will immortalize his name,
was the first to detect, under the directions of Sir E.
Home, the ultimate thread of which the muscular bundles
are composed<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>. Chemists distinguish the substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of which we are speaking, by the name of <i>fibrine</i>. By
the abundance of azote or nitrogen that enters into its
composition, it possesses a character of animalization
more marked than any other animal substance; and its
elements are so approximated in the blood, that the
slightest stagnation causes them to coagulate: and the
muscles are without doubt, in the living subject, the
only organs that can separate this matter from the mass
of blood, and appropriate it to themselves<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>. The
<i>primary</i> bundles of muscles are formed of the simple
fibres, and the <i>secondary</i> are the result of an aggregation
of the primary. The smaller bundles are not always
exactly parallel to each other, but must in many
cases diverge more or less, to produce those variations
in shape observable in the muscles themselves: there
are intervals therefore between the bundles, which in
some animals are filled by a cellular substance<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>. Probably
much of this statement will apply in most instances
to the muscles of <i>insects</i>, but we may conclude
that the globules that form them are infinitely smaller<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>.
Lyonet has given some interesting observations with
regard to those of the caterpillar of the <i>Cossus</i>: he describes
them as of a soft transparent substance, capable
of great extension, covered and filled by silver tubes of
the <i>bronchiæ</i>, penetrated by the nerves, and containing
oily particles. Each muscle was enveloped in membrane,
and was composed of many parallel bands, consisting
of bundles of fibres enveloped likewise in separate
membranes. The fibres themselves, (but it is doubtful
whether he arrived at the ultimate term of muscular
fibre,) in a favourable light and under a good magnifier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
appeared to be twisted spirally<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>. In spiders the muscles
seemed to him to consist of <i>two</i> substances, the one soft
and the other hard, the last forming a kind of stiff
twisted filament<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>. A muscle thus composed of different
bundles of fibres may be stated as to its <i>parts</i>, in
<i>insects</i>, to consist of base, middle, and apex: the <i>base</i> is
that part by which they are fixed to any given point of
the internal surface of the crust, or of one of its processes,
which serves as their fulcrum; the <i>apex</i> is that
part by which they are fixed, either mediately or immediately,
to the organ to be moved; and the <i>middle</i> is
the remainder of the muscle. We usually discover in
them no inflation of the middle corresponding with the
<i>belly</i> of the muscles in vertebrate animals; they occasionally,
however, terminate in a <i>tendon</i>, as those of the
thighs and legs; but these tendons are of a different nature
from the fibrous ones of warm-blooded animals;
for they are hard, elastic, and without apparent fibres:
the fleshy ones of the muscle envelope them, and are
inserted in their surface<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Shape.</i> The muscles of insects are usually <i>linear</i>,
with parallel sides; some are <i>cylindrical</i>, as those of the
wings of the <i>Libellulina</i><a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>; and others, as those that
move the legs in the caterpillar of the <i>Cossus</i>, are triangular<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>.
In the suctorious mandibles of the grub of a
common water-beetle<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> they are <i>penniform</i>, or shaped
like a feather; and some in the <i>Cossus</i> are forked<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
this head I may also observe, that the muscles are
sometimes extremely slender threads, crossing each
other, and often curiously interwoven in various directions,
so as to resemble lace or fine gauze, as may be
seen in the alimentary canal of some caterpillars<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>; sometimes
also they surround part of this organ, like a series
of minute rings<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>.</p>

<p>iv. <i>Colour.</i> The most usual colour of the muscles of
insects is <i>white</i>: those for flight however, according to
Chabrier, differ from the rest, by being of a deeper and
<i>reddish</i> colour<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>; and I have observed likewise that those
in the head of the stag-beetle, when dried at least, are
<i>red</i>, and look something like the flesh of warm-blooded
animals.</p>

<p>v. <i>Kinds</i> and <i>Denomination</i>. In general, muscles
may be regarded as divided into <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i>&mdash;the
<i>primary</i> being the muscles by which the <i>principal</i>
movements of any organs are effected, and the <i>secondary</i>
their auxiliaries which are the cause of <i>subordinate</i>
movements<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>. Every muscle almost has its <i>antagonist</i>,
the action of which is in an opposite direction; so that
when it is equal, the organ to which they are attached
remains without motion; but when that of one preponderates,
a movement in proportion takes place<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>. The
principal antagonist muscles that may be found in insects
are the following. 1. <i>Levator muscles</i> that <i>raise</i> an organ,
and <i>Depressors</i> that <i>depress</i> it. 2. <i>Flexors</i> that
<i>bend</i> an organ, and <i>Extensors</i> that <i>unbend</i> or extend it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
3. <i>Abductors</i> that draw an organ <i>back</i>, and <i>Adductors</i>
that draw it <i>forwards</i>. 4. <i>Constrictors</i> that <i>contract</i> an
opening, and <i>Laxators</i> that <i>relax</i> it. 5. <i>Supinators</i> that
<i>turn</i> the underside of an organ upwards, and <i>Pronators</i>
that <i>return</i> it to its natural situation. Some of these
muscles in insects, like some of their articulations and
their spinal chord<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>, seem to exercise a <i>double</i> function,&mdash;thus
the levators and depressors of the <i>wings</i> are constrictors
and laxators of the <i>trunk</i><a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>. At first it may
seem that insects, not having the power of turning up
the hand, cannot have the <i>Supinator</i> and <i>Pronator</i> muscles;
but some muscle of this kind must be in the <i>Gryllotalpa</i>,
and in those that have a versatile head<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>.</p>

<p>v. <i>Attachment</i> and <i>Insertion</i>. The attachment and
insertion of the muscles in insects in general is to the <i>interior</i>
of the crust, or to some of its internal processes
as a fulcrum, and to the organ to be moved. In some
cases, however, the muscles act upon the organ by the
intervention of other bodies. Thus, those that move
the wings are often attached to little <i>bones</i>, as Chabrier
calls them<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>, which are connected with the base of the
wings by ligaments. In the <i>Dynastidæ</i> and other Lamellicorns,
and the <i>Libellulina</i>, &amp;c., a remarkable provision
is made for giving a vast increment of force to the
muscles of the wings, by means of caps or cupules surmounted
by a tendon, which receive their extremity; the
tendon terminating in a fine point attached to the wing,
and thus more muscles are brought to bear upon it<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Chabrier seems to think that, in some cases, the <i>back</i>
that intervenes between each pair of wings is the medium
by which the muscles act upon it<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>.</p>

<p>vi. <i>Motions.</i> Irritability is the universal distinction of
the muscular fibre,&mdash;when put in action by the will or
involuntarily, it causes it to contract or become shorter;
and the intermediate agents of the will and other causes
are the <i>nerves</i>, which, as galvanic experiments seem in
some degree to prove, are the conductors of an invisible
fluid or power which immediately causes that action. If
a nerve is divided, the muscles to which it renders obey
it no longer, evidently proving that the nerves cause
muscular irritability<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>. How this contraction is immediately
effected,&mdash;whether the fibre, as some suppose,
undergoes any <i>crispation</i>, or becomes zigzag<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>, or whether
there is any sudden change in their <i>chemical</i> composition
that rapidly and strongly augments their cohesion,
as Cuvier hints<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>, cannot be clearly ascertained, unless
a Bauer could submit the <i>living</i> fibre to his glasses. All
that we know certainly on the subject is, that muscles
alternately contract and relax at the bidding of the will
or involuntarily, and so occasion all the movements of
animal bodies.</p>


<p>II. Having considered the muscles of insects in <i>general</i>,
I must next make a few observations, as far as my
means of information will enable me, upon those that
move their different <i>parts</i> and <i>organs</i>&mdash;at least the principal
ones; since to descend to minutiæ would be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
endless and unprofitable labour. As <i>larvæ</i>, except those
whose metamorphosis is <i>semicomplete</i><a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>, differ widely in
their system of muscles from <i>perfect insects</i>, I shall begin
my observations with them.</p>

<p>We owe by far the most accurate and detailed account
of the muscles of larvæ to the illustrious Lyonet,
who, with incredible labour and patience without example,
dissected the caterpillar of the <i>Cossus</i>, and has
described every air-vessel, every nerve, and every muscle
that could be detected by the microscope. Cuvier
also has given a description of the muscles not only of
caterpillars, but of the larvæ of the Lamellicorn beetles,
the <i>Hydrophili</i>, and the Capricorn beetles<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>. From these
sources are derived what I have now to lay before you.
If you look at one of Lyonet's plates<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>, the layers of
<i>longitudinal</i> muscles look like so many parallel ribands,
others run in an <i>oblique</i>, and others again in a <i>transverse</i>
direction<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>. He divides them into <i>dorsal</i>, <i>ventral</i>,
and <i>lateral</i> muscles<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>, terms which sufficiently explain
themselves. Of the <i>longitudinal</i> muscles there are <i>four</i>
principal rows<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>, the others are more numerous. The
principal object of these muscles, which are flexors and
extensors, is to shorten or lengthen the body, or to act on
any particular segment as the circumstances of the animal
may require. I shall not here notice the muscles
of the <i>head</i> and <i>legs</i>, as they are not <i>remarkably</i> different
from those of perfect insects. The <i>prolegs</i> are moved
by <i>two</i> muscles&mdash;the anterior one covering in part the
posterior&mdash;of a remarkable structure: one of their points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of attachment is by many branches or tails to the sole
of the foot, and by several heads to the skin of the animal;
so that they can draw the proleg within the body
or push it out, and perform other necessary movements<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall now call your attention to the muscles of the
<i>perfect</i> insect, as they move the <i>head</i> and its organs; the
<i>Trunk</i>; the <i>Abdomen</i>; and the <i>Viscera</i>.</p>

<p>i. The <i>Head</i>. This part in insects moves upwards,
downwards, inwards, to right and left, is pushed forth
or drawn in, is often capable in part of a rotatory movement,
and is sometimes versatile, turning as it were upon
a pivot. All these movements are of course produced
by an appropriate apparatus of <i>muscles</i>, which have their
attachment in the <i>anterior</i> part of the trunk, mostly in
the <i>manitrunk</i>, while their insertion is in the <i>posterior</i>
part of the head, in the margin of the occipital cavity.
To enumerate and describe them all would be tedious
and uninteresting&mdash;I shall only mention some of the
principal ones. The <i>levators</i> of the head are usually a
<i>pair</i> of muscles situated in the manitrunk, to the upper
side of which they are attached, and perhaps in <i>Coleoptera</i>
and some others to the <i>phragma</i>, which probably
Cuvier means by the <i>anterior</i> part of the <i>scutellum</i><a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>;
they are inserted in the posterior margin of the upper
part of the head, in <i>Coleoptera</i> in a <i>pair</i> of notches (<i>Myoglyphides</i><a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>),
or a single one<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>. In <i>Cordylia Palmarum</i>
these muscles as they approach the head, to judge from
the <i>dead</i> animal, divide into <i>two</i> branches or a fork:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
thus, as the muscle-notches are wide in this insect, the
muscle acts upon each extremity of the sinus&mdash;these
branches appear to be <i>tendinous</i><a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>. The <i>depressors</i> of
the head are the antagonist muscles to the above, and
have their attachment to the <i>antepectus</i> and its <i>antefurca</i><a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>.
A circumstance distinguishes these muscles in many <i>Coleoptera</i>,
that seems hitherto to have been overlooked.
If you take the common dung-beetle (<i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>),
and carefully extract the <i>head</i> with its muscles
from the trunk, you will see on each side of the depressors
a subovate corneous scale, of a pitch colour<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>, which
is attached only to the muscle, and designed to strengthen
it: if you then examine the anterior cavity of the <i>manitrunk</i>,
you will perceive on each side, just within the
lower margin, a minute triangular scale, of a similar substance;
these ligaments, like the pax-wax, or <i>ligamenta
nuchæ</i>, in <i>mammalia</i>, though in a lower situation, are
doubtless intended to sustain the action of the muscles.</p>

<p>With regard to the moveable <i>organs</i> of the head&mdash;the
<i>antennæ</i>, <i>maxillæ</i>, <i>palpi</i>, <i>tongue</i>, <i>mandibulæ</i>, &amp;c., have
each their appropriate apparatus of muscles: but I shall
only notice those of the last, the <i>mandibulæ</i>. These are
principally <i>abductors</i> and <i>adductors</i> to open and shut
them: from the work that the jaws of some insects have
to do, you may conjecture that they must be furnished
with powerful muscles. In caterpillars and other larvæ,
in which state the action of the mandibles is most in requisition,
the muscles are what Cuvier calls <i>penniform</i><a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>,
and are attached on each side to a tendinous lamina or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
cartilage. In the grub of <i>Dytiscus</i> the power and magnitude
of the <i>adductor</i> muscle is wonderful<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>. In the
<i>Orthoptera</i> this structure of the mandibular muscles takes
place also in the <i>imago</i><a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>; but in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, at least
in the stag-beetle and some others that I have examined,
these muscles in this state have no cartilage or tendon.
Their attachment is always to the <i>parietes</i> of the head,
of the cavity of which the <i>adductors</i>, in some cases, occupy
a considerable portion<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>. As to their insertion&mdash;these
last, in some <i>Orthoptera</i>, enter more or less the interior
of the mandible<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>; but commonly they are inserted
at or near the <i>interior</i> angle of the mandibular basal cavity,
and the <i>abductors</i> at the <i>exterior</i>.</p>

<p>ii. The <i>Trunk</i>. We have little information with regard
to the muscles of the parts of the trunk itself, by
which, in some insects, the manitrunk is enabled to
move independently of the alitrunk: it is more probable
that the levators have in part at least their attachment
to the anterior surface of the prophragm<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>, than that the
levators of the head should be there fixed, as Cuvier
seems to think; since both the <i>phragma</i> and the ligament
that appears in many cases to close the cavity of the
manitrunk round the viscera<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>, would prevent all communication
between those muscles and any part connected
with the scutellum: probably the depressors have
their attachment partly on the anterior face of the <i>medifurca</i><a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>.
These points, however, must be left to future
investigators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the <i>organs</i> of the trunk, we have more
certain and satisfactory information;&mdash;the muscles of the
<i>legs</i> having been described by Lyonet and Cuvier, and
those of the wings most particularly by Chabrier. In
caterpillars, the muscles are situated in the interior of
the articulations that form the legs: they consist of several
bundles appropriated to each, which have their attachment
in the <i>parietes</i> of the preceding joint, near the
margin, and are inserted in the margin of that they
move<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>. Lyonet counted <i>twenty-one</i> muscles in the leg
of the caterpillar of the <i>Cossus</i>; but eight of these were
appropriated to the claw, or rather formed a pair of <i>semipenniform</i>
muscles, having their insertion at the inner
angle of its base<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>. In <i>perfect</i> insects, according to Cuvier,
each joint of the legs is furnished with a <i>pair</i> of
antagonist muscles&mdash;a flexor and extensor, the former
being the <i>lower</i>, and the latter the <i>upper</i> muscle; and this
pair has its insertion in the joint it moves, and its attachment
usually in the preceding one: but those of the
coxæ&mdash;which are <i>rotators</i>, causing it to turn backwards
or forwards&mdash;and the extensor of the thigh, have their
attachment in the <i>parietes</i> of the trunk, and to the <i>endosternum</i>;
one of the <i>rotators</i> of the <i>anterior</i> coxa, and
the extensor of the <i>anterior</i> thigh to the <i>antefurca</i>; of
the <i>intermediate</i> pairs to the <i>medifurca</i>, and of the <i>posterior</i>
to the <i>postfurca</i><a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>. Every joint of the <i>tarsus</i> has also
its flexor and extensor. In the ground- and water-beetles
(<i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i> and <i>Eunech</i>in<i>a</i>), &amp;c., whose posterior
coxæ are immoveable, the thigh includes two pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
antagonist muscles<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>. In extracting the posterior leg of
<i>Necrophorus Vespillo</i> I observed more than a <i>single</i>
pair of muscles that had their attachment in the coxa;
and probably many other variations in this respect exist.</p>

<p>Little was known with respect to the most interesting
part of the muscular apparatus of insects, that by which
such wonderfully rapid and varied motions are imparted
to their organs of flight, till Chabrier undertook to
elucidate it; which he has done in a manner that will
confer a lasting honour upon his name, as one of the
most able successors to Swammerdam and Lyonet in
their peculiar department. He has given a most admirable
account of the internal anatomy of the trunk of
insects in general, as far as it relates to their flight;
particularly of that of the cockchafer (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>),
of one of the <i>Libellulina</i> (<i>Æshna grandis</i>), and
of a bumble-bee (<i>Bombus</i>); and I believe he has thus
illustrated insects of some of the other Orders, but his
memoirs on these I have not had an opportunity of consulting.
What I have to say on this subject, therefore,
will be principally derived from what he has communicated
with respect to the above insects.</p>

<p>A considerable difference in the volume of the muscles
of the wings takes place in insects according to the
force of their flight. Where it is rapid and powerful,
the alitrunk is nearly filled by them, and the alimentary
canal is much attenuated; but in those whose flight is
feeble, they occupy less space, and the alimentary canal
is proportionally enlarged<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>. In the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i>, the principal muscles of <i>both</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
wings have their attachment in the <i>anterior</i> portion of
the alitrunk<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>; in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, in the <i>posterior</i><a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>; and
in the <i>Libellulina</i>, those of the <i>anterior</i> wings are confined
to the <i>anterior</i> portion, and those of the <i>posterior</i>
pair to the <i>posterior</i><a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>. The muscles for flight in general
differ from others by their mass, length, and colour;
the bundles of fibres are very distinct, strong, and parallel;
their direction is uniform, according to the motion
they are to produce; their fibres are either attached to
the solid parts to be moved, or to cupules, but they never
terminate in a tendon; the muscles are perfectly independent
of each other, and the wings can be moved by
them separately<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>. As to their <i>denomination</i> and kind&mdash;the
principal ones are the <i>levators</i> and <i>depressors</i>, which
with respect to the <i>trunk</i>, as was before observed, are
<i>constrictors</i> and <i>laxators</i>. The <i>levator</i> muscles form
several distinct bundles in <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, &amp;c.;
in the <i>Diptera</i> there are three<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>; in the <i>Libellulina</i> they
seem to be <i>single</i>, are all environed with a blackish pellicle,
with numerous aërial vesicles, symmetrically arranged,
filling the interstices<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>. The most common
number is a levator to each wing; there are often, however,
as in the cockchafer and the dragon-fly, <i>two</i> depressors<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>:
but in the <i>Hemiptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and saw-flies
(<i>Serrifera</i>) amongst the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, the secondary
wings have distinct levators, but not depressors<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>; the
other insects of that Order have only a pair of each<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
The other wing-muscles are of a <i>secondary</i> description,
and auxiliary to the above. Their office is to extend
and close the wings: so that though the denomination
of <i>extensor</i> will suit the former, that of <i>flexor</i> is not so
proper for their antagonists; their office being not so
much to <i>bend</i>, as to bring back the wing to its station of
repose. The folding of certain wings, as those of <i>Coleoptera</i>,
<i>Dermaptera</i>, the <i>Vespidæ</i>, &amp;c., seems more the
function of the <i>abdomen</i> than of the wing-muscles; this
you may easily see, as I have often done, if you attend
to any <i>Staphylinus</i>, when after alighting from flight it
proceeds to fold up its wings under the elytra. Perhaps
the term <i>retractor</i> might not be inapplicable to the muscles
in question. Both these and the extensors are usually
small slender muscles, but sometimes numerous<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>.
They are larger in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and saw-flies<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>.
The muscles that open and shut the <i>elytra</i> of
<i>Coleoptera</i>, and probably of <i>Heteropterous Hemiptera</i>, and
which also aid their movements during flight, are very
slender<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>. With regard to the attachment and insertion
of the wing-muscles, it is according to two very distinct
types, one of which appertains to insects in general, and
the other is peculiar to the <i>Libellulina</i>. In insects in
<i>general</i>, the principal muscles for flight have not their
insertion in the wings, but act upon their bases by the
intervention of small long pieces. The depressors occupy
the middle and upper region of the alitrunk, and
are inserted anteriorly and posteriorly upon the concave
surfaces of two transverse horny semi-partitions, adapted
by their elasticity to dilate the trunk&mdash;and thus acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the part of both diaphragm and ribs<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>: but in the <i>Libellulina</i>,
as in birds, these muscles are placed on each side
of the point of support of the humerus<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>; the <i>depressors</i>
being attached immediately to the wings <i>without</i> it, and
the <i>levators within</i> it, with this sole difference, that they
are connected to the internal extremity of the base of
the wing by the intervention of a cupule terminating in
a tendon; all are disposed <i>perpendicularly</i> to the arms
of the levers on which they act, and all incline more or
less <i>outwards</i>, the one to <i>dilate</i>, and the other to <i>contract</i>
the trunk<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>. It may be observed in general, that in insects
formed upon the <i>first</i> type, the <i>great</i> action of these
muscles is the dilatation and contraction of the alitrunk,
the main tendency of which is to <i>depress</i> and <i>raise</i> the
wings<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>. I shall add here a few words upon the attachment
of the wing-muscles in the different Orders: but
first I must request you to read what I have said on the
partitions and chambers of the alitrunk in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>.
In most insects of the <i>first</i> type, the depressors
are longitudinal dorsal muscles that have their <i>posterior</i>
point of attachment in the <i>metaphragm</i> (<i>costale</i> Chabr.);
but the <i>anterior</i> varies:&mdash;in those that have <i>elytra</i>, <i>tegmina</i>,
or <i>hemelytra</i>, the muscles for them seem to be contained
in the chamber, varying in size, that lies between
the <i>prophragm</i> and <i>mesophragm</i>; and the anterior point
of attachment of their depressor muscles is the <i>mesophragm</i>:
they are also attached in some to the <i>metathorax</i>
or back of the posterior portion of the alitrunk<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
The levator muscles in <i>Coleoptera</i>, at least in the cockchafer,
by a long tendon have their posterior attachment
in the lower part of the posterior coxæ<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>, their anterior
attachment to the solid parts to be moved. In the <i>Cockchafer</i>
and the <i>Dynastidæ</i>, but <i>not</i> in <i>Geotrupes</i>, on each
side of the cavity of the metathorax under the base of
the wing is a large and small cupule, which from their
<i>lateral</i> situation one would think must receive the <i>levator</i>
muscles&mdash;apparently unnoticed by M. Chabrier; but as
there is a <i>pair</i> of these cupules on each side, there must
have been also a <i>pair</i> of muscles attached to them, which
does not agree with his statement<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i> the anterior attachment of the <i>depressors</i> is
to the back of the alitrunk and to the prophragm, and
the levators to the breast, and the sides of the back of
the trunk<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>. In the <i>Libellulina</i> the depressors and levators
that terminate, by a tendon surmounting a cupule,
in the base of the wings, have their posterior attachment
in the breast. These cylindrical muscles with their cupule
and tendon look like so many syringes<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>.</p>

<p>Having thus described to you the powerful muscular
apparatus by which, either mediately or immediately,
the <i>wings</i> of insects are moved, it will not be out of place
if I add a few words upon their <i>flight</i> itself. The great
object in this is to generate a centrifugal force which
may counteract the weight of the body. Its wings are
the <i>external</i> organs by which the insect as it were takes
hold of the air when they fall, and is impelled by it when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
they rise; its head makes way for it; its abdomen, as a
rudder, steers it; and by alternately increasing and diminishing
in volume, and rising and falling, enables it to
win an easy way through the fluctuations of the atmospheric
sea. The trunk by its elasticity admits the internal
action of antagonist muscles, which by turns compress
and dilate it; an action promoting the elevation
and depression of the wings, and keeping up the elasticity
of the internal air, which is thus now rarified and
now condensed: in the <i>former</i> state flowing like a tide,
accompanied by the blood, into the nervures of the
wings<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>, and thus increasing their tension and centrifugal
force;&mdash;in the <i>latter</i> ebbing and receding to the trunk,
thus relaxing the one and diminishing the other. The
spiracles by which the air enters or is expelled, open
and shut at the animal's pleasure<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>; and besides, many
insects are furnished, as we have seen<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>, with numerous
vesicles or reservoirs, which can give out a supply of internal
air when wanted: and thus they can vary their
aërial motions, diminish or increase the counteracting
centrifugal force; rise and fall, and move onwards and
in different directions, as their occasions demand.</p>

<p>iii. The <i>Abdomen</i> is perhaps capable of the greatest
variety of motions of the three primary sections of the
body. Even when the insect is reposing, a constant dilatation
and contraction usually takes place in it<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>; and
from its annular structure, its parts capable of separate
motion are numerous:&mdash;it expands and contracts; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
rises and falls; it bends in various directions; and its
segments can often be lengthened or retracted. Besides
all this, its spiracles open and shut, and its reproductive
and other anal organs have their appropriate motions.
In numerous <i>Coleoptera</i>, however, and some <i>Hemiptera</i>,
the <i>upper-side</i> of the abdomen is almost the only part
that is moveable, especially near the trunk; the <i>under-side</i>,
having its first segments soldered together, is only
capable of motion near the tail<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>. The muscles that produce
the various motions of this part must be entitled to
all the denominations stated above<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>. I have on a former
occasion explained to you how, in insects that have a
petiolate abdomen, that part is elevated and depressed<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>.
In those with a sessile one the base is attached to the
metaphragm by strong ligaments<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>, and the muscles that
move the first piece act from one segment to another.
The <i>partial</i> movements of the segments of this part,
where they have place, are produced by muscular fibres
which extend from the whole <i>anterior</i> margin of one to
the whole <i>posterior</i> one of that which precedes it. If
those, for example, of the back contract, the abdomen
becoming shorter above, bends upwards; and if those
of the sides or belly, it bends sideways or downwards<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>:
this is a beautiful as well as simple contrivance.</p>

<p>The alternate rush of air from the abdomen into the
alitrunk, and from the atmosphere into the abdomen, is
attended by the constriction or expansion of that part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
as it rises or falls in flight<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>, which seems to require the
action of constrictor and laxator muscles.</p>

<p>iv. The <i>Viscera</i>. Having before had occasion sufficiently
to notice the muscles by which the systole and
diastole of the <i>dorsal vessel</i> of insects is maintained<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>, I
shall now only mention those that are <i>woven</i> round their
alimentary canal, by which the peristaltic motion of that
organ, causing its contractions and the propulsion of
its contents, takes place. One would at first think that
a view of the <i>intestines</i> of any animal could under no
circumstances afford any very pleasing spectacle to the
eye of any but a scientific spectator; but any <i>lady</i> who is
fond of going to Disons to be tempted with an exhibition
of fine lace, would experience an unexpected gratification
could she be brought to examine those of a caterpillar
under a microscope: with wonder and delight
she would survey the innumerable muscular threads that
in various directions envelope the gullet, stomach, and
lower intestines of one of these little animals; some running
longitudinally, others transversely, others crossing
each other obliquely, so as to form a pattern of rhomboids
or squares; others again, surrounding the intestine
like so many rings, and almost all exhibiting the appearance
of being woven, and resembling fine lace,&mdash;one pattern
ornamenting one organ; another, a second; and another,
a third. This will suffice to give some idea of this
part of the muscular structure of these little animals<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>.</p>

<p>Lyonet counted the muscles contained in the body
of the caterpillar of the <i>Cossus</i>. In the head he found
228; in the body, 1647; and enveloping the intestines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
no less than 2186; which, after deducting 20 that are
common to the gullet and the head, gives a total of 4061<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>.
In the human subject only 529 have been counted<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>: so
that this minute animal has 3532 muscles more than the
Lord of the creation!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The muscles of the <i>Arachnida</i> seem less numerous
than those of insects. In the <i>Scorpionidea</i> they appear
to be robust, formed of simple straight fibres, of a whitish
gray colour: a muscular web, rather strong, clothes the
<i>parietes</i>, but rarely adheres to them, of the abdomen,
and envelopes the <i>viscera</i>, with the exception of the lungs,
and probably of the heart. The dorsal part of this web
gives birth to seven pairs of filiform muscles, which traverse
the liver, and are attached to a muscular riband
which, passing above the lungs, runs the whole length
of the ventral <i>parietes</i>. These muscles when exposed to
view resemble extended cords. The abdominal segment
preceding the tail is filled with a powerful muscular mass
which moves that organ<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>. Treviranus discovered two
longitudinal muscles in <i>Scorpio europæus</i>, running from
the breast to the tail, which above and below each gill
were connected by another running transversely across
the heart, thus forming a quadrangular area in which
the gills are situate<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>. The heart appears to be moved
by muscles not very dissimilar to those of the <i>Cossus</i><a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>,
as is likewise that of the <i>Araneidea</i>; in <i>Clubiona atrox</i>
the wider part of this organ is muscular, and incloses a
considerable cavity<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>. In this tribe the muscles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
abdomen, the skin of which is soft and unfit to act as a
lever to them, are attached to a cartilage, and thus their
action is better sustained<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>.</p>

<p>Having thus laid before you all of importance that I
can collect with regard to the apparatus of muscles discoverable
in insects, I shall next say something upon a
few other points connected with that subject. When I
enlarged upon their <i>motions</i>, I related a few instances of
the extraordinary power of that apparatus<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> in <i>leaping</i>
ones; but this power is not confined to that circumstance.
The <i>flea</i>, not more remarkable for its compressed
form, enabling it to glide between the hairs of
animals, and its elastic coat of mail, by which it can resist
the ordinary pressure of the fingers, than for its muscular
strength, has attracted notice on this account from
ancient times. Mouffet relates that an ingenious English
mechanic, named Mark, made a golden chain of
the length of a finger, with a lock and key, which was
dragged by a flea;&mdash;he had heard of another that was
harnessed to a golden chariot, which it drew with the
greatest ease<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>. Another English workman made an
ivory coach with six horses, a coachman on the seat with
a dog between his legs, a postillion, four persons in the
coach, and four lacqueys behind&mdash;which also was dragged
by a single flea. At such a spectacle one would
hardly know which most to admire, the strength and agility
of the insect, or the patience of the workman. Latreille
mentions a flea of a moderate size dragging a silver
cannon on wheels, that was twenty-four times its own
weight, which being charged with powder, was fired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
without the flea appearing alarmed<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>. Many caterpillars
are accustomed to extend their bodies from a twig, supported
merely by the four hind feet, in one fixed attitude,
either in an oblique, horizontal, or vertical direction,
either upwards or downwards, and that for hours together.
We may conceive what prodigious muscular
force must be exerted upon this occasion, by reflecting
that the most expert rope-dancer, though endued with
the power of grasping with his feet like a bird with its
claws, could not maintain himself in a horizontal position
even for an instant. Bradley asserts that he has seen a
stag-beetle carry a wand half a yard long and half an
inch thick, and fly with it several yards<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>. Some insects
have the faculty of resisting pressure in a wonderful degree.
If you take a common dung-chafer (<i>Geotrupes</i>)
in your hand and press it with all your strength, you
will find with what wonderful force it resists you; and
that you can scarcely overcome the counteraction, and
retain the insect in your hand: was it not for this quality,
the grub of the gad-fly must be crushed probably in
passing through the anal sphincter of the horse<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>. But
that of <i>Eristalis tenax</i> affords a more surprising instance
of this power of counteraction:&mdash;an inhabitant of muddy
pools, it has occasionally been taken up with the water
used in paper-making, and strange to say, according to
Linné, has resisted without injury the immense pressure
given to the surrounding pulp<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>; like <i>leather-coat Jack</i>
mentioned by Mr. Bell<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>, who, from a similar force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
muscle, could suffer carriages to drive over him without
receiving any injury. Almost as remarkable is the state
of extreme relaxation into which the muscles of some
larvæ fall, when their animation is suspended; and the
revived tension to which a subsequent resumption of the
vital powers restores them. Bonnet having suspended
the animation of the caterpillar of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i> by
keeping it submerged, squeezed it between his fingers,
until it had wholly lost its cylindrical form and was as
flat and supple as the empty finger of a glove; yet in
less than an hour the very same caterpillar became as
firm, as compact, as cylindrical, and in short, as well,
as though it had never been submitted to treatment so
rough<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that animals of a large size, as has been
well remarked, especially noxious ones, have not been
endowed with a muscular power proportionable to that
of insects. A <i>cockchafer</i>, respect being had to their size,
would be <i>six</i> times stronger than a <i>horse</i>; and if the <i>elephant</i>,
as Linné has observed, was strong in proportion
to the <i>stag-beetle</i>, it would be able to pull up rocks by
the root, and to level mountains<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>. Were the <i>lion</i> and
the <i>tiger</i> as strong and as swift for their magnitude as the
<i>Cicindela</i> and the <i>Carabus</i>, nothing could have escaped
them by precaution, or withstood them by strength.
Could the <i>viper</i> and the <i>rattlesnake</i> move with a rapidity
and force equivalent to that of the <i>Iulus</i> and <i>Scolopendra</i>,
who could have avoided their venemous bite? But the
<span class="smcap">Creator</span> in these little creatures has manifested his Almighty
<span class="smcap">power</span>, in showing what he could have done
had he so willed; and his <span class="smcap">goodness</span> in not creating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
higher animals endued with powers and velocity upon
the same scale with that of insects, which would probably
have caused the early desolation of the world that
he has made. From this instance we may conjecture,
that after the resurrection, our bodies by a change in
the structure and composition of their muscular fibre&mdash;for
we know that their locomotive powers and organs,
as far as the muscle is concerned, will then be of a very
different nature<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>&mdash;may become fitted for motions and a
potent agency of which we have now no conception.</p>

<p>This wonderful strength of insects is doubtless the result
of something peculiar in the structure and arrangement
of their muscles, and principally their extraordinary
power of contraction, excited by the extent of their
respiration: for animals that respire but little, as the
f&#339;tus in the womb and the pullet in the egg, have very
little contractile muscular power<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>. To get some idea
from facts of this extraordinary contractile power in insects,&mdash;extract
the sting of a bee or a wasp, with its muscles,
which appear to be attached to powerful cartilaginous
plates<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>, and you will find it continue for a long
time to dart forth its spicula, almost as powerfully as
when moved by the will of the animal. A still more
extraordinary instance of irritability is exhibited by the
<i>antlia</i>, or instrument of suction of the butterfly. If this
organ, which the insect can roll up spirally like a watchspring
or extend in a straight direction, be cut off as
soon as the animal is disclosed from the chrysalis, it will
continue to roll up and unroll itself as if still attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to its head: and if after having apparently ceased to
move for three or four hours it be merely touched, it
will again begin to move and resume the same action.
This surprising irritability and contractility of muscle
doubtless depends upon the peculiar structure of the
antlia, which is composed of an infinite number of horny
rings, acted upon by muscles, more numerous probably
than those which move the trunk of the elephant. The
motion only ceases when the muscles become dry and
rigid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have already, under another head<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>, considered the
<i>annual</i> sleep, or winter state of torpidity of insects, during
which an intermission for the most part of muscular motion
and action takes place. I shall now make a few
observations with respect to their <i>diurnal</i> sleep, which
may very properly have its place in the present letter.
That insects, usually so incessantly busy and moving in
every direction, require their intervals of repose, seems
to call for no proof. We see some that appear only in
the <i>day</i>, and others only in the <i>night</i>, others again only
at certain hours; which leads to the conclusion, that
when they withdraw from action and observation, it is
to devote themselves to rest and sleep. The cockchafer
flies only in the evening; but if you chance to meet with
it roosting in a tree in the earlier part of the day, you
will find it perfectly still and motionless, with its antennæ
folded and applied to the breast:&mdash;we cannot indeed say
that its eyes are shut; for as insects have no eyelids, that
sign of sleep can never be found in them. Again, if a
Lepidopterist goes into the wood to capture moths in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the day-time, he finds them often perched on the lichens
that cover the north side of the trunk of a tree, with
their wings and antennæ folded, and themselves without
motion, and insensible of his approach and their own
danger. Thus it was that I captured that rare insect
the lobster-moth (<i>Stauropus Fagi</i>) in the New Forest.
Some, however, have asserted that the caterpillar of the
silkworm, except when they moult, never intermits
feeding day or night, and consequently does not sleep:
but the accuracy of this statement, both from analogy
and observation, admits of great doubt. Malpighi informs
us that these caterpillars for an hour and more,
twice a day, remain immoveable with their heads bent
down as though asleep, and even if disturbed, resume
again the same inactive posture<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a>; and other larvæ in
great numbers certainly seem to have regular intermissions
from eating of considerable duration: those called
Geometers, for hours together remain motionless projected
from a twig, to which they adhere by their posterior
prolegs alone; and the processionary caterpillars
make only <i>nightly</i> sorties from their nests, passing the
day in inaction and repose<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>. Bees have been often seen
by Huber, when apparently wearied with exertion, even
in the middle of the day, to insert the half of their bodies
into an empty cell, and remain there, as if taking a nap,
without motion for half an hour or longer<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>; and at night
they regularly muster in a state of sleep-like silence.
Mr. Brightwell once observed an individual living specimen
of <i>Haltica concinna</i>, which appeared to remain
motionless on the same spot of a wall for three successive
days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Before concluding these remarks on the Internal
Anatomy and Physiology of Insects, I shall explain to
you, as you will probably feel inclined occasionally to
pursue the subject, the best mode of <i>dissecting</i> them.&mdash;By
far the most useful dissecting instruments for this
purpose are very fine-pointed and sharp <i>scissors</i>, as these
will enable you to divide the integument and separate
other parts with much less risk of injuring their delicate
structure than any knife. These scissors are what Swammerdam
chiefly used; and he had some so extremely
small and fine, that he was necessitated to employ a lens
when he sharpened them. If to these be added a sharp
and fine-pointed <i>knife</i> or two, some <i>needles</i> fixed in
handles, also fine-pointed&mdash;(you will find them more
convenient than any other instrument for detaching
minute parts and fibres,) a pair of fine and accurately
adjusted <i>pliers</i>, and an assortment of camel's-hair <i>brushes</i>,&mdash;you
will be nearly set up as an Entomological dissector.
You will still, however, require a small dissecting
table, with a projecting and moveable arm for lenses
of various descriptions, so as to admit both the hands
to be employed upon the subject under examination;
and for this purpose probably no contrivance can be
better adapted than that of Lyonet, of which the figure
in Adams <i>On the Microscope</i> will convey a better idea
than any description<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>.</p>

<p>Previously to dissecting any insect, it must be killed
by plunging it into boiling water, which is recommended
by Lyonet, or spirits of wine or of turpentine; and it is
often useful to let <i>larvæ</i> remain a few days in the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
by which means the vessels become firmer and stronger.
The parts of <i>pupæ</i> become much more distinct if they
are boiled for a few minutes: and the same mode may
be adopted in the examination of spiders.</p>

<p>The most convenient mode of proceeding, which was
that also of Lyonet, is to dissect the insect in water, or,
to avoid putridity, in diluted spirits,&mdash;if small, upon a
concave glass, to which it should be fastened by means
of a little melted wax; if larger, in the bottom of a common
chip box, surrounded with a border of wax to retain
the fluid. The integuments of the insect, being
carefully divided longitudinally with scissors, should if
flexible be turned back, and fixed by small pins stuck in
by a fine pair of pliers, while the skin at the same time
is stretched by another. After making such observations
as present themselves without further dissection,
the viscera must be cautiously extracted, washing away
the fat which surrounds them with spirits of turpentine,
in which it is soluble, applied by camel's-hair pencils.
After separation they may conveniently be examined by
putting them into water, and gently shaking them so as
to cause the parts to unfold. If endowed with the patience
of Swammerdam, you may even arrive at injecting
these minute parts with wax or coloured fluids,
conveyed by delicate glass tubes having one end as fine
as a hair, which he also employed to fill the viscera
with air; and afterwards drying them in the shade, and
anointing them with oil of spike in which a little resin
had been dissolved, he succeeded in preserving them. If
it is not convenient to finish the dissection of an insect
at once, it should be covered with spirits of wine. Swammerdam
found a mixture of spirits and distilled vinegar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
very useful for keeping caterpillars previously to dissecting
them, as it consolidated the parts<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>.</p>

<p>And now having brought to a close my long wanderings
in this ample and intricate field, and having threaded,
as well as my slender powers and limited knowledge
enabled me, the infinite turnings and convolutions of
this Dædalean labyrinth&mdash;the <i>Anatomy</i> and <i>Physiology</i>
of insects,&mdash;will you not own that the volume of wonders
I have laid before you proves irrefragably that,
though these minims of nature apparently rank so low
in the scale of being, yet in their structure, instead of
being, as might be expected, more simple, they are infinitely
more complex and highly wrought than those
animals that are placed the nearest to ourselves? the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>
in the latter doing every thing by a beautiful <i>simplicity</i>;
while in the former, the more to magnify his power

by a wonderfully curious and intricate <i>multiplicity</i>: and
whether we study the one or the other, we shall in both

<h2><a name="LETTER_XLIV" id="LETTER_XLIV">LETTER XLIV.</a></h2>

<h3><i>DISEASES OF INSECTS.</i></h3>


<p>Having laid before you what observations I thought
might sufficiently explain all the principal features of the
Anatomy of insects both external and internal, you will
next expect to be informed whether, like the higher animals,
they are subject to have the admirable order observable
in their frame interrupted by <i>Disease</i>; and you
will perhaps imagine, from the multiplicity of their organs
and vessels, that they must be peculiarly exposed to
derangements of the vital and other functions. That they
have their diseases is certain; but, except in the case of
their appropriate parasitic assailants, which is a part of
their economy, it does not appear that their maladies
are more numerous and frequent than those of other
animals. The same <span class="smcap">Almighty Power</span> which endowed
them with so complex a structure, generally upholds
them in health during their destined career, until they
have fulfilled the purpose of their creation, when <i>they
die and return again to their dust</i><a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>.</p>

<p>But perhaps I may seem to you as making too great
a parade about these little insignificant creatures if I assign
a separate letter to the consideration of their <i>diseases</i>:
but when you recollect that Aristotle has a chapter on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
this subject<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>, and that the learned Willdenow has devoted
a distinct portion of his excellent introductory work
on Botany to the diseases of Plants<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>,&mdash;you will perhaps
be of a different mind: indeed, some facts I shall
have to communicate are so remarkable and interesting,
that I am sure, when you have read this letter, you will
not think the subject one that deserves to be slighted.</p>

<p>Insect diseases may, I think, be divided into two great
classes; those resulting, namely, from some accidental
<i>external</i> injury or <i>internal</i> derangement, and those produced
by <i>parasitic</i> assailants.</p>

<p>I. Under the <i>first</i> head we may begin with <i>wounds</i>,
<i>fractures</i>, <i>mutilations</i>, and other <i>extraneous</i> causes of disease.
To these&mdash;insects are peculiarly subject; and
though they are not, like the <i>Crustacea</i> and <i>Arachnida</i><a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>
and some other invertebrate animals, endowed with the
power of <i>reproducing</i> a mutilated limb, yet their wounds
appear to heal very rapidly, and at the time they are inflicted
to produce little pain<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>. But if those important
members, their <i>antennæ</i>, are mutilated, insects seem to suffer
a kind of derangement; the great organ of their communication
with each other, and in various respects with
the external world, being removed, all their instincts at
once fail them. I formerly related how the amputation
of these affects the <i>queen-bee</i><a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>. A similar result, as Huber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
tells us<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>, follows, when the same experiment is repeated
on the <i>workers</i> or <i>drones</i>: they immediately become
unable to take any further part in the labours of
the hive; they can no longer guide themselves except in
the light; if they petition one of their fellow-citizens for
honey, they are unable to direct their tongue to its mouth
to receive it; they remain near the entrance of the hive,
and when the light is intercepted they rush out of it to
return no more.</p>

<p>Insects occasionally are subject to <i>tumours</i> or a preternatural
enlargement of their parts and organs. The antennæ
of bees sometimes swell at their extremity so as
to resemble the bud of a flower ready to open, becoming
at the same time very yellow, as does the fore part
of the head<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>. I once saw a specimen of a <i>Hydrobius</i>&mdash;agreeing
with <i>H. fuscipes</i> in every other respect even to
the most minute punctum&mdash;which had a large tumour
on each side of the <i>prothorax</i>, evidently accidental, occasioned
probably by the stoppage of the pores by which
the superfluous moisture and air escape when it undergoes
its last change. The converse of this I have observed
to take place sometimes in the same part of <i>Geotrupes
foveatus</i>, the ordinary lateral <i>foveæ</i> becoming very
considerably enlarged;&mdash;this was the case with the specimen
from which Mr. Marsham made his description
of that insect. The species is, however, very distinct in
other respects, and may always be known by its small
size. It happens now and then also, that these tumours
represent <i>blisters</i>. I saw one once on one elytrum of a
beetle and not on the other. Those of <i>Serropalpus</i> (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Mr. MacLeay, on the authority of M. Clairville, informs
me) are particularly subject to this disease. But, of
all the organs, the wings are most exposed to derangements
of this kind. De Geer, in a specimen of <i>Pieris
Cratægi</i> just excluded from the chrysalis, observed that
one of these was distended by a considerable quantity of
extravasated green fluid&mdash;two or three large drops following
an incision. This disease appeared to arise from the
lower membrane not adhering to the upper; so that the
nervures&mdash;which are rather longitudinal channels, being
open below, than tubes&mdash;were not closed to confine the
fluid to its proper course. The malady, which might be
called a dropsy of the wing, carried off the insect the
day after its exclusion<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>. Reaumur observed that the
wings of some flies were affected by an <i>air</i>-dropsy, as he
calls it, which appeared to arise from the air escaping
from its natural channels, and thus separating, the two
membranes that form the wing, and filling the cavity
produced by their separation<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes also <i>monstrosities</i> are to be met with in
these animals, or variations from a symmetrical structure
in organs that are pairs. I have a beetle in which the
terminal joint of one of the maxillary palpi is short, ovate,
and acute; and that of the other, long, semiovate, and
rather obtuse. A specimen of <i>Blaps mortisaga</i> in my
cabinet, taken by Mr. Denny, besides the terminal mucro
of the <i>elytra</i>, has a long diverging lateral one. Goeze
had the larva of a <i>Semblis</i> brought to him in which one
of the two fore-legs, though perfect in all its parts, was
only half the length of the other<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>; which he regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
as a reproduction, but it seems rather a malformation.
Müller mentions a most extraordinary fact of one of the
<i>Noctuidæ</i>, which when disclosed from the pupa retained
the head of the larva<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>. One of the most remarkable
instances of this kind that have fallen under my own
observation, may be seen in a specimen of <i>Chrysomela
hæmoptera</i> in the cabinet of our friend Curtis; in which
one of the thighs produces a double tibia, but only one
of these is furnished with a tarsus.</p>

<p>The diseases of insects which arise from some <i>internal</i>
cause are not very numerous. The first that I shall
mention is a kind of <i>vertigo</i>. "Ants have also their
maladies," says M. P. Huber: "I have noticed one extremely
singular; the individuals attacked by it lose their
power of guiding themselves in a straight line, they can
walk only by turning round in a circle of small diameter
and always in the same direction. A virgin female shut
up in one of my glasses was seized on a sudden with this
distemper; she described a circle of an inch in diameter,
and made about a thousand turns in an hour, or not
quite seventeen in a minute. She continued constantly
turning round for seven days, and when I visited her in
the night I found her still in motion. I gave her honey&mdash;and
I think that she ate some of it." He observed
that some workers were attacked by a similar disease:
one of these, however, had the power of walking from
time to time in a straight line; when placed upon its head
it continued its gyrations<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>. Similar motions of a little
moth, mentioned on a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>, may perhaps
have been produced by the same cause. Bees are also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
subject to vertigo, which has been attributed to their
eating poisonous honey<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>&mdash;but may not this disease in all
these cases arise from some derangement of the nervous
system? One of the ants which was so affected had lost
one of its antennæ; but as this was not the case with the
others, no great stress is to be laid upon the circumstance.
Huber does not inform us whether those attacked by
this disease recovered or not.</p>

<p>I have observed more than once, that the <i>flesh-fly</i> and
some others of the same tribe are subject in particular
seasons to a kind of <i>convulsions</i>. When thus attacked,
they kick and struggle, and seem unable to fly. Sometimes
they lie upon their backs without motion, but if a
finger be placed near them their convulsive motions are
renewed. When thrown into the air, instead of flying,
they fall to the ground. Had this distemper occurred earlier
or later in the year I should have attributed it to the
benumbing effects of cold; but as my observations were
made one year (1816) in <i>May</i>, and in another (1811) in
the latter end of <i>June</i>, this could scarcely be the case.
In the year last mentioned I observed that many flies
died under its influence. In wet seasons this tribe is
subject to another disease, which proves fatal to many of
them, and indeed to other <i>Diptera</i>. A white crust appears
to be formed upon the abdomen both above and
below, of a granular appearance, much resembling fine
moist sugar. On the back of that part this crust does
not cover the margins of the segments, which gives it
the appearance of white bands; so that deceived by it, I
have often at first flattered myself that I had met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
some new species. The under-side of the abdomen is
wholly covered by it, divided in the middle into two longitudinal
masses, the anal segment being bare. De Geer
has noticed this or a similar disease, which, when flies are
attacked by it, causes the abdomen to swell so as even
to burst, and the segments become dislocated. Upon
opening the abdomen it is found filled with a white unctuous
substance, which often accumulates (as above described)
on its external surface<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>. Dr. Host says that
in this disease when the animal is dead, the wings, which
were before incumbent, become extended, and its almost
invisible pubescence grows into long hairs<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>. De Geer
seems to think that these flies are thus affected in consequence
of having eaten some poisonous food<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>; but I
rather suspect, as I have observed it become prevalent
chiefly in wet seasons, that it arises from a superabundance
of the nutritive fluid, or of the fat, so that it seems
to be a kind of <i>plethora</i>. I once observed a fly fixed to
a pane of glass, round which was a semicircle of what
appeared to be merely vapour, whose radius was nearly
three-fourths of an inch. Taking it for an aqueous
fluid that had transpired from the dead animal, I paid
no further attention to it at that time: but observing
from day to day that the moisture did not evaporate,
after two or three months had elapsed, I had the curiosity
to examine it more closely, and, upon scraping some
of it off with a penknife, I found it was a white substance
of a fatty nature. In this case, then, the fat must
have exploded on all sides with considerable violence
from half the body or the abdomen. Probably this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
a more intense degree of plethora. When I examined
this appearance the fly had fallen off, and I could not
find it.</p>

<p>Mr. Sheppard once brought me a panicle of grass, the
glumes of which were rough with hairs, or small bristles,
to which several specimens of a fly related to <i>Xylota
pipiens</i> adhered by their proboscis. At first I thought
that having been entrapped by the bristles, and unable
to extricate themselves, they had perished from want of
food; but since when touched they readily dropped from
the glumes, some other cause, perhaps disease, probably
occasioned this singular suspension of themselves.</p>

<p>The maladies to which <i>bees</i> and <i>silkworms</i> are subject
are more interesting to us than those of <i>flies</i>, on account
of their utility as <i>cultivated</i> insects. One of the worst
distempers which attacks the first of these animals is a
kind of <i>looseness</i> or <i>dysentery</i>: this happens early in the
year, when they are fed with too much honey without
any portion of bee-bread<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>, and sometimes destroys whole
hives. Their excrements, instead of a yellowish red,
then become black, and the odour they emit is insupportable;
the bees no longer observe their usual neatness,
inducing them to leave the hive when they void their excrements,
but they defile it, their cells, and each other.
Several remedies have been prescribed for this disease.
To prevent it, a syrup made by an equal mixture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
good wine and honey is recommended; and as a cure, to
place in the hive combs containing cells filled with bee-bread<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>.
But one of the worst maladies to which these
useful animals are subject, is that called by Schirach
<i>Faux Couvain</i>. It originates with the larvæ; and is caused
either by their being fed with unwholesome food, or when
the queen, as sometimes happens, lays her eggs so that
the head of the grub is not in a proper position for
emerging from the cell when the period for its disclosure
is arrived:&mdash;the consequence is, that in both cases it dies
and becomes putrid, which sometimes produces a real
pestilence in a hive. The remedy for this evil is to cut
away the infected combs, and to make the bees undergo
a fast of two days<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>. The hive should be cleaned and
fumigated, by burning under it aromatic plants.</p>

<p>The cultivators of the <i>silkworm</i> in France have given
names to several diseases to which that animal is subject.
One is called <i>La Rouge</i>, and is supposed to be occasioned
either by too great heat, or by too sudden a transition
from cold to heat. It takes place when the caterpillar
is first hatched; which lives perhaps, but in a very sickly
state, till it should spin its cocoon and assume the pupa,
when it expires. Another degree of the same disease is
called <i>Les Harpions</i> or <i>Passis</i>. A second distemper of
this animal is <i>Des Vaches</i>, <i>Le Gras</i> or <i>La Saune</i>: this
is a mortal disease, supposed to be of a putrid nature,
and produced by mephitic air; it shows itself after
the second moult, but rarely after the subsequent ones.
When a caterpillar is first attacked, changing the air
may prove a remedy; but when the disease has made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
progress, it is best to burn or bury them, since if the
poultry pick them up they might be poisoned by them.
A third disease of silkworms is called <i>Les Morts Blancs</i>,
or <i>Tripes</i>, which is also occasioned by impure air, when
the leaves the animal feeds upon are heaped so as to
produce fermentation. The caterpillars attacked by it
die suddenly, and preserve after their death the semblance
of life and health. Too great heat, whether artificial
or natural, occasions <i>La Touffe</i>, a fourth, which,
when the heat continues long, destroys all those that
are arrived at their last stage of existence in their larva
state. Black points scattered over different parts of the
body, or livid and blackish spots in the vicinity of the
spiracles, followed by a yellowish or reddish tint, are
symptoms of a fifth malady, called <i>La Muscardine</i>.
After this the animal soon dies, and becomes mouldy,
but does not stink. This disease is not contagious, and
is thought to be caused by a moist heat, attended by
pernicious exhalations. <i>La Luzette</i>, <i>Luisette</i>, or <i>Clairène</i>,
is another malady, which shows itself most commonly
after the <i>fourth</i> moult. It seems to arise from some
original defect in the <i>egg</i>. The caterpillars attacked by
it may be known by their clear red and afterwards dirty
white colour; their body becomes transparent, and the
matter of silk exudes in drops from their spinnerets;
consequently, though as voracious as the rest, they are
never able to construct a cocoon, and should be destroyed.
<i>Les Dragées</i> is the name given to cocoons
which include a larva that never becomes a pupa. The
cause of this disorder has not been ascertained, and whole
broods are sometimes subject to it, which, as in the last,
seems to imply some defect in the <i>eggs</i>. But as the caterpillar
spins its cocoon, and the silk is as good as usual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
it is a malady of no great importance. Lastly, sometimes
the mulberry leaves have a gummy rather acrid
secretion, which purges the silkworms; their excrement
is no longer solid; they become weak and languid; and
if the secretion is abundant, their transpiration is impeded,
and at the time of moulting they are become so feeble as
to be unable to cast their skin<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of many caterpillars of <i>Lepidoptera</i> that
died, Bonnet found by dissection that the disease was
remotely occasioned by a <i>diarrhea</i>, which taking place
immediately before they became pupæ, prevented the
inner membrane of their intestines from being rejected,
as it would have been if no extraordinary cause had
prevented it, attached to the hard excrement. He found
this membrane converted into a jelly occupying great
part of the stomach, which he conjectured was the proximate
cause of their death<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>.</p>

<p>To conclude this head&mdash;<i>spiders</i> are reputed to be subject
to the <i>stone</i>: I do not say <i>Calculus in Vesica</i>; but
we are informed by Lesser that Dr. John Franck having
shut up fourteen spiders in a glass with some valerian
root, one of them voided an ash-coloured calculus
with small black dots<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>.</p>

<p>II. I now come to that class of diseases which appears
to prevail almost universally amongst insects&mdash;I mean
those resulting from the attack of <i>parasitic</i> enemies.
Thus millions and millions annually perish before they
have arrived at their perfect state. Diseases of this kind
proceed either from <i>vegetable</i> or <i>animal</i> parasites. I shall
begin with the first, which will not occupy us long.</p>

<p>i. As insects pass often no small portion of their life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in a state of torpidity, in which they remain chiefly without
motion, it will not seem wonderful, should any partial
moisture accidentally accumulate upon them, that it
affords a seed plot for certain minute fungi to come up
and grow in. Persoon observes with regard to his genus
<i>Isaria</i>, that one species grows upon the <i>larvæ</i> of insects
(<i>I. truncata</i>), and another upon <i>pupæ</i> (<i>I. crassa</i><a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>):&mdash;as
he does not say upon <i>dead</i> larvæ and pupæ, as upon
a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>, perhaps in these cases these plants
may constitute an insect disease; but I lay no stress
upon it, and only mention the circumstance here as connected
with the history of these animals. Mr. Dickson
has described a <i>Sphæria</i> under the name of <i>entomorhiza</i>
that grows upon <i>dead</i> larvæ; it has a slender long stipes
and spherical granulated head: on the pupa of a species
of <i>Cicada</i> in my cabinet, another kind of <i>Sphæria</i>,
with a twisted thickish stipes and oblong head, springs
up in the space between the eyes. I observed something
similar but longer, in the grub of some large beetle in
M. Du Fresne's museum at Paris; and I have a memorandum
of having noticed something of the kind on the
rostrum of a <i>Calandra</i>. Bees and humble-bees have
been sometimes thought to have some species of <i>mucor</i> or
other <i>Fungilli</i> occasionally growing upon them; but
Mr. Brown is of opinion that <i>stamina</i> which they have
filched from flowers have been mistaken for these <i>Fungilli</i>,
since he has detected those of <i>Orchideæ</i> in some
of this tribe, and upon a beetle shown to him by Mr.
MacLeay, one which he knew to be the stamen of an
<i>Aristolochia</i>. I once observed a bunch of what I mistook
for a singular <i>mucor</i> that adorned the vertex of a
humble-bee, between the antennæ, which doubtless were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of the same description; and I even saw one upon its
wing. Upon a former occasion I mentioned a parallel
circumstance with respect to a species of <i>Xylocopa</i><a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>.</p>

<p>ii. The <i>animal</i> parasites that infest insects are either
themselves <i>insects</i>; or <i>worms</i>.</p>

<p>1. Their <i>insect</i> infesters, as far as we know at present,
are confined to the Orders <i>Strepsiptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
<i>Diptera</i>, and <i>Aptera</i>: they attack them sometimes in their
<i>egg</i> state, most frequently when they are larvæ, occasionally
when pupæ, and very rarely in their perfect state.
Upon many of these I have formerly enlarged<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>, and
I shall now add such further circumstances as I then
omitted. The <i>Strepsiptera</i> Order, as at present known,
consists only of two genera, <i>Stylops</i> and <i>Xenos</i>; the first
being appropriated to the imago of <i>Andrena</i>, a kind of
<i>bee</i>, and the latter to that of the <i>wasps</i>. Their eggs appear
to be deposited in the abdomen of these insects in
which they feed, till having attained their full growth
they perforate the membrane that connects its segments;
and at the proper time their pupa-case bursts, they emerge,
and take their flight. Sometimes four or five infest a
single bee. Whether the latter dies upon their quitting
it I have not been able to ascertain, but from their flying,
when the little parasite is very near leaving them,
with their usual activity, it should seem that this disease
is not mortal; but it probably prevents their breeding:
I do not recollect observing the exuviæ of one in a <i>male</i>
bee<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>.</p>

<p>The great body of insect parasites, however, belong
to the <i>Hymenoptera</i> Order, and chiefly to the Linnean
genus <i>Ichneumon</i>. The insects of this order have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
denominated <i>Principes</i>, because of the wonderful instincts
of ants, wasps, bees, and other gregarious tribes that belong
to it; and they merit a name of honour not less for
the benefits that they confer upon mankind, by keeping
within their proper limits the various insect-destroyers
of the produce of the globe. It deserves notice that
when these latter increase to a degree to occasion alarm,
their parasites are observed to increase in a much greater,
so as to prevent the great majority of them from breeding<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>.
Though these benefactors of the human race constitute
numerous genera, at present not well ascertained,
I shall speak of most of them under the common name
of <i>Ichneumon</i>.</p>

<p>The appearance of these little four-winged flies puzzled
much the earlier naturalists:&mdash;that a caterpillar usually
turning to a <i>moth</i> or <i>butterfly</i> should give birth to myriads
of <i>flies</i>, was one of those deep mysteries of nature
which they knew not how to fathom<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>: even the penetrating
genius of our great Ray, though he ultimately
ascertained the real fact<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>, was at one time here quite at
fault; for he seems at first to have thought, when from
any defect or weakness nature could not bring a caterpillar
to a butterfly, in order that her aim might not be
entirely defeated, that she stopped short, and formed
them into more imperfect animals<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>.</p>

<p>Before I detail more particularly the proceedings of
Ichneumons, I shall make a few general remarks upon
them. The structure of the instrument by which they
are enabled to deposit their eggs in their appropriate
station has been before sufficiently described<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>; it is long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
or short according to the situation and circumstances of
the larva which receives them: if this lives in the open
air, and the access to it is easy, it is usually <i>short</i> and
retracted within the body; but if it lies concealed in deep
holes or cavities, or shuns all approach, it is often very
long. Thus in <i>Pimpla Manifestator</i>, which commits its
eggs to the grub of a wild bee inhabiting the bottom of
deep holes bored in posts and rails, the ovipositor is
nearly an inch and half in length, and in some extra-European
species three inches. How the egg is propelled
so as to pass in safety from the oviduct, along this
extended and very slender instrument to the grub for
which it is destined, has not been certainly ascertained:
but from an observation of Reaumur's<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> it should seem
that it is aided in its passage by some fluid ejected at the
same time with it, or is so lubricated as to slide easily
without being displaced. The flies we are speaking of, by
some authors are called <i>Muscæ vibrantes</i>, because when
searching for the destined nidus of their eggs their antennæ
vibrate incessantly, and it is by the use of these
wonderful organs that they discover it wherever it lurks.
Bergman observed that <i>F&#339;nus Jaculator</i> searches for the
latent grub of certain bees and other <i>Hymenoptera</i> with
its antennæ<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>: and from Mr. Marsham we learn that
<i>Pimpla Manifestator</i>, before it inserts its ovipositor in the
nest of the grub of <i>Chelostoma maxillosa</i>, explores it first
with one antenna and then with the other, plunging
them all the while intensely quivering up to the very root<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>.
With respect to their <i>size</i>, Ichneumons vary greatly;
some being so extremely minute as to be invisible to the
naked eye, unless moving upon glass; while others, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
their <i>length</i>, emulate the giants amongst insects. The
former, unless appropriated to the eggs themselves, usually
commit many eggs to a single larva, while the latter
are directed by their instinct to introduce into them only
one. Some of the former description are endowed with
the faculty of leaping<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>. The food of Ichneumons, and
indeed of other internal parasites, is chiefly the <i>epiploon</i>
or fat of the larva, but they never touch any vital organ;
so that it continues to feed, and probably more voraciously,
grow, cast its skin, and often it changes to a chrysalis,
although at the same time inhabited by an army of
these little devourers.</p>

<p>Ichneumons, as far as has been at present ascertained,
are parasitic upon other insects chiefly in their <i>three</i> first
states, a solitary instance only having been observed of
their inhabiting an <i>imago</i>; but from their first exclusion
as eggs from the ovary till their assumption of that state
they give them no rest. I shall therefore first treat of
those that infest the <i>eggs</i>; next those appropriated to
<i>larvæ</i>; and lastly those that devour <i>pupæ</i>.</p>

<p>Vallisnieri appears to have been the first naturalist
who discovered that Ichneumons were appropriated to
the <i>eggs</i> of other insects. He observed one proceed
from those of the emperor-moth (<i>Saturnia Spini</i>): finding
two holes in each egg, one larger than the other, he
conjectured that one was made when it entered, and the
other when it emerged. In this case the egg of the
Ichneumon must be fixed on the outside of the egg it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
was to feed upon; though some appear to pierce it with
their ovipositor, and consequently introduce their egg
within: for he says afterwards; "I have seen with my
own eyes a certain kind of wild flies deposit their eggs
<i>upon</i> other eggs, and <i>bore</i> and pierce others with an
aculeus&mdash;by which they have introduced the egg<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>."
Count Zinanni, a correspondent of Reaumur's, saw an
Ichneumon pierce the eggs with her ovipositor repeatedly;
which in about fifteen days were filled with the
pupa, and in six more produced the imago<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>. <i>I. Ovulorum</i>
L. is the only <i>known</i> species of egg-devourers;
but most likely there are many, varying in size, according
to the size of the egg they inhabit. Probably
<i>I. Atomus</i> L., and <i>I. Punctum</i> Shaw, are of this description<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>.
It is wonderful what a number these little flies
destroy:&mdash;out of a mass of more than <i>sixty</i> eggs which
was brought to De Geer, not <i>one</i> had escaped the Ichneumon<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>.
But the most extraordinary thing is, that
even these little creatures we are told are destroyed by
another still more minute<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>.</p>

<p>Though the animals we are speaking of usually destroy
only a <i>single</i> egg, yet some appear not so to confine
themselves. Geoffrey informs us that the larva of one
of the Ichneumons whose females are without wings
(<i>Cryptus</i>) devours the eggs of the nests of spiders, and
from its size&mdash;it is nearly a quarter of an inch long&mdash;it
must require several of them to bring it to maturity<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>.
One of those also which destroys the gnat infesting
the wheat (<i>I. inserens</i>) appears to devour them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
their <i>egg</i> state, and could not be brought to perfection
by the food that a single one would furnish<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>.</p>

<p>The Ichneumons that are parasitic upon <i>larvæ</i> are
the most numerous of all. Some of them are deposited
by the parent fly on the <i>outside</i> of their prey, and others
introduced into its <i>interior</i>. <i>Ophion luteum</i> is one of
the former tribe; it plants its eggs in the skin of the
caterpillar of the puss-moth (<i>Cerura Vinula</i>). Each
egg is furnished with a footstalk terminating in a bulb<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>,
which is so deeply and firmly fixed that it is impossible
to extract it without detaching a portion of the animal
with it, and even when the caterpillar changes its skin it
is not displaced. After it is hatched, the grub, while
feeding, keeps its posterior extremity in the egg-shell,
to which it adheres so pertinaciously, that it is scarcely
possible to disengage it without crushing it. It fixes
itself by its mandibles to the skin of the caterpillar, and
keeps constantly sucking the contents of its body till it
dies: sometimes nine or ten of these larvæ inhabit a
single caterpillar<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>. Reaumur has given an account of
other external Ichneumons. Upon one caterpillar that
he examined, they were so numerous as to render the
poor animal quite a spectacle, and they underwent their
metamorphosis attached to it<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>. One species of this description
avenges the cause of insects upon their most
pitiless foes, the all-devouring spider&mdash;for in the midst
of her toils and lines of circumvallation it makes her its
prey. De Geer, meeting one day with a young spider
of a common kind, observed with surprise, engaged in
sucking it, a small white grub, which was firmly attached
to the abdomen near the trunk. Putting it by in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
glass, after some days he examined it again; when he
observed that it had spun the outline of a vertical web,
had stretched threads from the top to the bottom of the
glass and from one side to the other, and had also spun
the radii that meet in the centre, and this was all;&mdash;but
what was remarkable, the larva that had fed upon it was
suspended in the centre of this web, where it was engaged
in spinning its own cocoon, while the spider, exhausted
by this last effort, had fallen dead to the bottom
of the glass. It cannot be asserted positively that this
suspension of the larva of the Ichneumon in the centre
of the web <i>always</i> takes place; but if it does, as seems
most probable, it shows that this little parasite is endowed
with an instinct which causes it so to act upon
the spider as may induce it to spin a web so nicely timed
as to be sufficiently complete at the period of its death
and of the change of the Ichneumon, for the latter to
cast it down and assume its station<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>.</p>

<p>But the great bulk of the parasitic Hymenopterous devourers
of larvæ have their assigned station <i>within</i> the
body. As Entomologists in breeding insects have paid
their principal attention to <i>Lepidoptera</i>, it necessarily
follows that their Ichneumon infesters must be most
generally known; but doubtless the larvæ of the other
Orders are not wholly liberated from this scourge: they
also require to be kept within due limits, and have their
appropriate parasites. Some, however, in most of them
have been detected: of which I shall now proceed to
state to you the most interesting examples, beginning
with the <i>Coleoptera</i>.</p>

<p><i>Alysia Manducator</i><a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a>, remarkable for having mandibulæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
that do not close, and toothed at the end, usually attends
masses of dung, both of man and cattle, probably
for the purpose of depositing its eggs in some of the <i>Coleopterous</i>
larvæ that inhabit it. Mr. Stephens, one of
the most accurate observers as well as one of the best
Entomologists of the present day, informs me that he
once captured three specimens of <i>Timarcha tenebricosa</i>,
from each of which forty or fifty minute Ichneumons
emerged. An insect also of this Order, that is a great
benefactor to mankind, as a destroyer of the plant-lice,&mdash;I
mean the lady-bird (<i>Coccinella</i>), in its larva state is
itself subject to the attack, as we learn from De Geer,
of one of these small parasites<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>. He detected them also
in that of two species of weevils: and in the pupa of
some large grub of a beetle inhabiting the wood of the
elm, perhaps that of the stag-beetle, he found the pupa
of one of those Ichneumons that have an exserted ovipositor<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>.
Doubtless, did we know their history, we
should find that numberless species have their internal
assailants belonging to this tribe.</p>

<p><i>Orthopterous</i> larvæ seem not to have been yet announced
as affording a pabulum to these animals: but
the late Dr. Arnold, whose tact for observation with regard
to the manners and economy of insects has rendered
his loss irreparable, discovered that the remarkable
parasitic genus <i>Evania</i> was appropriated to the all-devouring
<i>Blatta</i>. Whether it attacked it in its egg or
larva state I have not been informed. This little benefactor
is here extremely rare, at least in the <i>country</i>;
perhaps in <i>towns</i>, where the cock-roach abounds, it may
be more common.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>The observations of naturalists have chiefly been confined
to the <i>Hemipterous</i> genus <i>Aphis</i>; but these early
attracted their notice. Leeuwenhoek has given a particular
and entertaining account of the proceedings of
<i>I. Aphidum</i>. As soon as the little flies approached
their prey, they bent their abdomen, which is rather
long, between their legs, so that the anus projected beyond
the head; then with their ovipositor they pierced
the body of the Aphis, at the same time carefully avoiding
all contact with it in every other part: whenever they
succeeded in their attempt, a tremulous motion of the
abdomen succeeded. Only a single egg is committed to
one Aphis: when hatched, the latter becomes very
smooth and appears swelled; it is, however, full of life,
and moves when touched. Those that are thus pricked
separate themselves from their sound companions, and
take their station on the <i>underside</i> of a leaf. After some
days the inclosed grub pierces the belly of the Aphis,
and attaches the margin of the orifice to the leaf by silken
threads; upon this it dies, becomes white, and resembles
a brilliant bead or pearl<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>. De Geer observed also an
Ichneumon on the Coccus of the elm, <i>I. Coccorum</i><a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>.</p>

<p>Amongst the <i>Neuropterous</i> tribes likewise, probably
the <i>Ichneumonidæ</i> commit their usual ravages; but their
exploits, as far as I recollect, have met with no historian.
I have a small species related to <i>Chelonus</i>, which a memorandum
made when I took it tells me was obtained
from <i>Æshna viatica</i>; yet I do not remember ever tracing
that species to its final change, so that I must have taken
this Ichneumon from the <i>perfect insect</i>. It suffices, however,
to prove that this tribe is also exposed to the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of these parasites. Where larvæ and pupæ are
<i>aquatic</i>, it seems probable, if any attack is made upon
them, that it must take place after they have quitted the
water.</p>

<p>In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> Order itself, almost every genus
has been ascertained to have its Ichneumon parasites.
Not even the fortified habitations of the gall-flies (<i>Cynips</i>)
can escape them, almost every species becoming
their prey; a circumstance which puzzled not a little
some of the older naturalists, when they at one time saw
a fly not remarkable for its colours or brilliancy emerge
from the curious moss-like <i>Bedeguar</i> of the wild rose,
and at another were struck by the appearance of one of
those splendid minims of nature which almost dazzle the
sight of the beholder<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>. Immunity, however, from this
pest seems to have been granted to the <i>gregarious Hymenoptera</i>;
at least none has yet been discovered to attack
the ant, the wasp, the humble-bee, or the hive-bee;
in which last, had there been one appropriated to it, it
could never have escaped the notice of the Reaumurs
and the Hubers. The <i>solitary</i> bees, however, as we
have seen above<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>, do not escape; and <i>Epipona spinipes</i>,
a <i>solitary</i> wasp which feeds its own young with a number
of green caterpillars<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>, is itself, when a larva, though
concealed in a deep burrow, the prey of the grub of an
Ichneumon, which by means of a long ovipositor introduces
its egg into its body<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>. Even these parasites,
whose universal office it is in their first state to prey
upon insects, are themselves subject to the same malady.
Ichneumonidan devourers are kept in check by other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Ichneumonidan devourers. These in some cases are so
numerous as to destroy the tithe of the kinds they attack<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>.
Thus an ever-watchful <span class="smcap">Providence</span> prevents
these parasites from becoming so numerous as to annihilate
in any place the species necessary for the maintenance
of the general economy and proportion of animal
and vegetable productions. Amongst the assailants of
the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, none seem to have a more laborious
task assigned them than those that pierce the various
galls in which the larvæ of the <i>Cynips</i> tribe are inclosed.
To look at an oak-apple, we should think it a work of
difficulty, requiring much sagacity and address, for one
of our little flies to discover the several chambers lurking
in its womb, and to direct their ovipositor to each
of them. Its <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, however, has enabled it instinctively
to discover this, and furnished it with an appropriate
elongated instrument, which will open a way to
the deep and hidden cells in which the grubs reside,
penetrate their bodies, and to each commit an egg.
When it prepares to perforate the gall, the Ichneumon
begins by depressing this organ, that it may extricate it
from its sheath; it next elevates its body as high as possible,
and bending the instrument till it becomes perpendicular
to the body and to the gall, so as to touch
the latter with its point, it then gradually plunges it in,
till it is quite buried<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>. A very remarkable Hymenopterous
parasite (<i>Leucospis</i>), which when unemployed turns
its ovipositor over the back of its abdomen, so that its
end points to its head, is said to deposit its eggs in the
nest of the mason-bee, most probably in the larva: but
the curious observations that are stated to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
made by M. Amédée Lepelletier upon its history have
not yet been given to the public<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Dipterous</i> insects, likewise, do not escape from these
pests of their Class: but few observations, however, have
been recorded as to the species assailed by them. We
learn from De Geer, that a gnat (<i>Cecidomyia Juniperi</i>),
which forms galls upon the juniper is devoured by an
external Ichneumon<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>; that which injures the wheat in
the ear, whose ravages I formerly mentioned to you<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>, affords
food to three of these parasites,&mdash;one I lately mentioned
as probably devouring its eggs; another pierces
the glumes of the floret, where its destined prey is concealed;
and the third enters it. I once placed a number
of the larvæ of the gnat upon a sheet of paper, at no
great distance from each other, and then set down one
of these last Ichneumons in the midst of them. She began
immediately to pace about, vibrating her antennæ
very briskly: a larva was soon discovered, upon which
she fixed herself, the motion of her antennæ increasing
intensely; then bending her abdomen obliquely under
her breast, she inserted her ovipositor, and while the
egg was depositing these organs became perfectly motionless.
The larva when pricked gave a violent wriggle.
This operation was repeated with all that had not already
received an egg, for only one is committed to each
larva. I have often seen it mount one that was already
pricked, but it soon discovered its mistake, and quitted
it untouched<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>. The Hessian Fly also (<i>Cecidomyia Destructor</i>)
related to the preceding, whose alarming ravages
I formerly described to you<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>, has a peculiar parasite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
attached to it, which keeps it in check. The only
other Dipterous insects that I have seen mentioned as
affording pabulum to an Ichneumon, are&mdash;one of the
aphidivorous flies mentioned by De Geer, who does not
note the species, to the larva of which the Ichneumon
commits only a single egg, producing a grub that intirely
devours its interior<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>;&mdash;and two described by Scopoli,
one, the larva of a <i>fly</i> frequenting hemp; and the other,
which feeds on a <i>Boletus</i>, that of a <i>gnat</i><a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Lepidoptera</i>, however, is the Order over the larvæ
of which the Ichneumons reign with undisputed sway;
attacking all indiscriminately, from the minute one that
forms its labyrinth within the thickness of a leaf, to the
giant caterpillar of the hawk-moth. The most useful of
all, however, the silkworm, appears at least with us, exempted
from this scourge. De Geer, out of fifteen larvæ
that were mining between the two cuticles of a rose-leaf,
belonging to the first tribe here alluded to, found that
<i>fourteen</i> were destroyed by one of these parasites, only
one coming forth to display itself in all its brilliancy and
miniature magnificence<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a>. One of the most useful to us
is that which destroys the clothes-moth, which the same
writer also traced<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a>. Another, equally serviceable, takes
up its abode in the caterpillar that ravages our cabbages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and brocoli (<i>Pontia Brassicæ</i>) which perish by hundreds
from its attacks. As this falls frequently under our notice,
it will not be uninteresting to give a fuller account
of it. Reaumur has traced and related its whole history.
One of these little flies that he observed, was so intent
upon the business in which she was engaged, that she
suffered him to watch her motions under a lens, without
being discomposed. She pursued nearly the same plan
of proceeding with that of the Ichneumon of the wheat-gnat
just described; except that she repeated her operations
frequently on the same caterpillar in different parts,
alternately plunging in and extracting her ovipositor.
She seemed to prefer the spot where the segments of the
body are united, particularly where the eighth meets the
ninth, and the ninth the tenth. When the fly had completed
its work and quitted the caterpillar, Reaumur
gave it food, and it did not seem less lively and vigorous
than others of its kind; in less than a fortnight it assumed
the pupa; and in four days the whole of its interior
being devoured, it died: but its parasites, perhaps
not finding a sufficient supply of nutriment in it, never
came to perfection<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>. Sometimes, however, these little
grubs arrive at maturity before the caterpillar has become
a chrysalis, when they pierce the skin and begin to
emerge. First appears a little white tubercle, which gradually
elevates itself in a direction perpendicular to the
body; while this is doing, a second appears in another
place; and so on, till fifteen or sixteen are seen on each
side, giving the caterpillar a very grotesque appearance.
By the alternate contraction and relaxation of their bodies
the grubs effect their complete liberation, which takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
place with respect to the whole in less than half an hour.
When entirely disengaged, they place themselves close
to the sides of the caterpillar: even before this they begin
spinning, and draw unequal threads in different directions,
of which they form a cottony bed, which serves
as the base of the separate cocoon of each individual,
which they next construct of a beautiful silk thread of a
lovely yellow, which, if it could be unwound and in sufficient
quantity, would yield a silk unrivalled in lustre and
fineness<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>.</p>

<p>De Geer has recorded a very singular fact which deserves
your notice. An Ichneumon, appropriated to one
of the <i>Tortrices</i>, had deposited its eggs in two of their
caterpillars; each produced a considerable number; but
those that emerged from one were all <i>females</i>, and those
from the other, <i>males</i><a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a>. He observed a similar fact take
place with <i>Misocampus Puparum</i><a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>. One might conjecture
from this circumstance, that as in the queen-bee<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a>, so in
these Ichneumons, the eggs producing the two sexes
were arranged separately in the ovaries. Reaumur has
related, that in one instance three or four males were
produced to one female; and in another four or five females
to one male<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a>.</p>

<p>But though the great majority of insects are subject to
this <i>Scolechiasis</i><a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> in their larva state, yet sometimes they
are not attacked by the <i>Ichneumon</i> till they have become
<i>pupæ</i>. Of this kind is one just mentioned (<i>M. Puparum</i>),
which commits its eggs to the chrysalis of the butterfly
of the nettle, <i>Vanessa Urticæ</i>: the moment this caterpillar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
quits its skin to assume that state, while it is yet
soft they pierce it and confide to it their eggs<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a>. De Geer
and others have supposed that this same Ichneumon attacks
the <i>Cocci</i> and <i>Coccinellæ</i><a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a>; but this probably is an
erroneous supposition. <i>Cryptus Compunctor</i> also attacks
the pupæ of butterflies<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>.</p>

<p>If we consider the great purpose of <span class="smcap">Providence</span> in
giving being to this tribe of destroyers&mdash;the keeping of
insects within their proper limits,&mdash;we may readily conceive
that this purpose is more effectually answered by
destroying them in their <i>preparatory</i> than in their <i>ultimate</i>
state, since at that time the laying of their eggs and
a future progeny could not so effectually be prevented;&mdash;this
will account for there being few or no Ichneumons
appropriated to them in their latter state.</p>

<p>The next tribe of insect parasites are to be found in
the <i>Diptera</i> Order. The species that has been particularly
noticed as such is the <i>Tachina Larvarum</i>; its larva
is polyphagous, laying its eggs <i>upon</i> the bodies of caterpillars
of different kinds. Sometimes a pair is placed on
the first segment, sometimes on the head itself, and sometimes
near the anus. These eggs are very hard, convex,
of an oval figure, polished and shining like a mirror.
They are fixed so firmly that if you attempt to remove
them with a penknife the skin comes off with them.
When hatched, they enter the body and feed on the interior,
and, undergoing their metamorphosis within it,
do not emerge till they enter their perfect state. The
caterpillar thus attacked lives long enough to spin its
cocoon, when it dies<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a>. Sometimes, however, these animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
quit their prey sooner. Reaumur saw a grub of
one of the <i>Muscidæ</i> come out of a caterpillar, and then
become a pupa, which was so large that he wondered
how it could have been contained in the animal it had
quitted<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>.</p>

<p>We have now done with those parasites that produce
in insects the disease I have called <i>Scolechiasis</i><a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>: the
rest, which belong to the <i>Aptera</i> Order, will afford us
examples both of <i>Phthiriasis</i> and <i>Acariasis</i><a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>.</p>

<p>I begin with the <i>first</i>. Mr. Sheppard once brought
me a specimen of a bird-louse (<i>Nirmus</i>) which he took
upon a butterfly (<i>Vanessa Io</i>): and should such a capture
be more than once repeated, it would afford a <i>certain</i>
instance of the <i>first</i> of these diseases amongst insects;&mdash;but
most probably the specimen in question had dropped
from some bird upon the butterfly. The only remaining
animal belonging to the apterous hexapods that is parasitic
on insects, is by many supposed to be the larva of a
giant-beetle (<i>Meloe Proscarabæus</i>). I have before alluded
to this animal<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>, and shall now resume the subject. G&#339;dart,
Frisch, and De Geer, observed that it deposited in
the earth one or two considerable masses, containing an
infinite number of very minute orange-coloured eggs
adhering to each other, which in about a month were
hatched, and produced a number of small hexapods distinguished
by two pairs of anal setæ and a proleg, by
means of which they could move readily upon glass, as I
have myself seen: these little animals precisely corresponded
with one found by the latter author upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
<i>Eristalis intricarius</i>; and when that fly was placed amongst
them, they immediately attached themselves to it, so as
to leave no doubt of their identity<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>. A congenerous
species had been detected upon wild bees, and described
by Linné under the name of <i>Pediculus Apis</i>. De Geer
is so thoroughly to be depended upon for his veracity
and accuracy of observation, that we cannot suppose
there is any incorrectness in his statement. If the mass
of eggs be, as he represents it, of the size of a hazel-nut,
it must have been the product of a very large insect:
in confirmation of this opinion it may be further observed,
that the larva of the kindred genus <i>Cantharis</i>
agrees with it in having anal setæ, though it appears to
differ in having only two conspicuous segments in the
trunk<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>. Those which infest wild bees make their first
appearance upon <i>acrid</i> plants, which the <i>Meloe</i> likewise
feeds upon; from whence with wonderful agility they
leap upon the <i>Andrenæ</i>, &amp;c. that visit these flowers.
Strong, however, as all these facts appear, still we cannot
help exclaiming with the illustrious Swede last named,
Who could ever have imagined that the larva of this
great <i>beetle</i> would be found upon the body of <i>flies</i>,&mdash;and
we may add, or <i>bees</i>? Who could ever imagine that it
would feed like a <i>bird-louse</i> and resemble it so closely?
that in the insertion of its palpi it should exhibit a character
<i>exclusively</i> belonging to that tribe<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>? Another
circumstance seems to indicate that these hexapods at the
time that they take their station in bees or flies are perfect
insects&mdash;they do not vary in size, at least not materially.
Where, we may also ask, if they are to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
large beetles, where do they take their principal growth?
It cannot be as parasites on the little bees or flies that
they are usually found upon; they must soon desert
them, and like their kindred blister-beetles, as is most
probable, have recourse to vegetable food. What an
anomaly <i>in rerum natura</i>! It is much to be wished that
some skilful insect-anatomist would carefully dissect the
<i>Meloe</i>; or perhaps by digging round the roots of the
ranunculuses and other acrid plants the larva of that
beetle might be discovered in a later stage of growth,
and so this mystery be cleared up. I should observe
here, that Scopoli has described three parasites as <i>Pediculi</i>;
viz. <i>P. rostratus</i>, <i>coccineus</i>, and <i>Cerambycinus</i>; the
first of which Fabricius has adopted under the name of
<i>P. Gryllotalpæ</i>, but which are all evidently hexapod
<i>Acarina</i><a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Acariasis</i> seems a disease almost as universal amongst
insects as <i>Scolechiasis</i>; with this difference however, that
<i>Acari</i> most commonly take their station upon them in
their <i>perfect</i> state. You have doubtless often observed
the common dung-beetles (<i>Geotrupes</i>) covered on the
underside of their body with small mites (<i>Gamasus
Coleoptratorum</i>) which look as if they were engaged
in suction&mdash;they are often so numerous that no part is
uncovered; they also attack other beetles<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>, and are sometimes
found on humble-bees. They are easily disturbed,
run with great swiftness, and may often be seen in hotbeds
and fermenting dung prowling in search of the
stercorarious beetles. But the most remarkable insect
of this kind is the <i>Uropoda vegetans</i>: it derives its nutriment
from the insects it assails not by its <i>mouth</i>, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
by means of a long <i>anal pedicle</i> by which it is attached
to them. De Geer found these in such numbers upon
a species of <i>Leptura</i>, that its whole body was almost
covered with them; they hung from the legs and antennæ
in bunches, and gave the animal a most hideous and disgusting
appearance. Under this load of vermin it could
scarcely walk or move, and all its efforts to get rid of
them were in vain: many were attached to its body and
to each other by their anal pedicles, but others had cast
them off and were walking about. When put into a
glass with earth, they began to abandon their prey, so that
in a few days it was quite freed from its plagues. He
found that these parasites lived long in alcohol<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a>.</p>

<p>If you inquire&mdash;How are these mites originally fixed by
their pedicles? it seems most probable, that as the <i>Hemerobii</i>,
when they lay their eggs, know how to place
them upon a kind of footstalk, so the parent <i>Uropoda</i>
has the same power; and this pedicle appears to act the
part of an umbilical chord, conveying nutriment to the
f&#339;tus not from a <i>placenta</i>, but from the body of the insect
to which it is attached; till having thus attained a
certain maturity of growth and structure, it disengages
itself and becomes locomotive. Many eggs of the aquatic
<i>Acarina</i> (<i>Hydrachna</i>, &amp;c.) are also furnished with a
short pedicle by which they are fixed to <i>Dytisci</i> and
other water insects. De Geer found some of this description
on the underside of the water-scorpion, so
thickly set as to leave no void space: they were oval, of
a very bright red, and of different sizes on different individuals;
whence it was evident that they grow when thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
fixed: when hatched or released&mdash;for perhaps they may
be regarded as f&#339;tuses in their <i>amnios</i> rather than eggs&mdash;they
cease to be parasitical. Let us admire on this
occasion, (piously observes this great Entomologist,) the
different and infinitely varied means by which the <span class="smcap">Author</span>
of Nature has endowed animals, particularly insects,
for their propagation and preservation: for it is a
most extraordinary sight to see eggs grow, and pump as
it were their nutriment from the body of another living
animal<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>. As these mites are fixed to the <i>crust</i> as well as
its inosculations, they must have some means of forcing
their nutriment through its pores.</p>

<p>Another insect, remarkable for its resemblance in some
respects to the scorpion&mdash;called in this country the book-crab
(<i>Chelifer cancroides</i>), from its being sometimes found
in books&mdash;occasionally is parasitic upon flies, especially
the common blue-bottle-fly (<i>Musca vomitoria</i>). They
adhere to it very pertinaciously under the wings; and if
you attempt to disturb them, they run backwards, forwards,
or sideways, with equal facility.</p>

<p>Spiders also are infested by mites. Mr. Briggs once
found a very small <i>Theridion</i>, to the thorax of which
were attached four oblong bright scarlet mites, each of
which was as large as the thorax itself. He afterwards
met with another spider still smaller, attacked by two of
these swoln parasites, one of which appeared to him
nearly equal to the spider in size. This mite was probably
either <i>Leptus Phalangii</i>, or <i>Astoma parasiticum</i>.</p>

<p>2. We now come to a perfectly distinct tribe of insect
parasites, which belong to that section or order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
intestinal <i>worms</i> which Rudolph has denominated <i>Entozoa
nematoidea</i>, and Lamarck <i>Vers rigidules</i><a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a>. To
this tribe belong the <i>Gordius</i> of Linné and the <i>Filaria</i>
of modern zoologists, which from the experiments and
observations of De Geer, Dr. Matthey, &amp;c. appear to
have been too hastily separated, being really congenerous,
and living indifferently in water and in the intestines
of insects and other animals<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>. To this genus
belong the guinea-worm (<i>Gordius medinensis</i><a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>), the
<i>Furia infernalis</i>, and several others that are found in
various vertebrate animals. These little worms have
been discovered in insects of almost every Order; and
their attack generally produces the death of the animal,
though they appear not to devour those parts that are
essential to life<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>. I once took a specimen of <i>P&#339;cilus
azureus</i>, and upon immersing it in boiling water I was
surprised to see what at first I mistook for an intestine,
thrust itself forth; but upon a nearer inspection, to my
great surprise I found it was one of these worms, thicker
than a horse-hair and of a brown colour. Mr. W. S.
MacLeay also once found one in <i>Abax Striola</i>. It still
remains in my specimen, making it appear as if it had a
long tail. De Geer long ago found these worms in
grasshoppers<a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>; but Dr. Matthey has given the fullest
account of one which infested <i>Acrida viridissima</i>. A
friend of his noticing one of these insects which had not
strength enough to leap and could scarcely even walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
being struck with the circumstance, caught the animal,
upon which its hind legs were immediately detached
from it. His surprise was greatly increased when he
saw issue from its body a cylindrical worm about two
feet and a half in length. Upon being called, Dr. M.
soon recognised it for a <i>Gordius</i> or <i>Filaria</i>; and on his
putting it into water, it moved in it with great velocity,
twisting its long and slender body in all directions.
Upon opening the body of the grasshopper, nothing appeared
within it but the intestine shrunk up to a thread.
A few days after, another was brought, which appeared
in full vigour, but its abdomen was enormously distended,
and from it another worm was extracted, which remained
without motion rolled in a spiral direction: intending to
preserve this in spirits of wine&mdash;as it had become flat he
first immersed it in water, that it might recover if possible
its cylindrical form. Upon immersion a movement
took place in the animal, and it gradually recovered its
plumpness; but it still remained without motion, as if
dead, for nearly five days, when another living specimen
being brought and placed with it, as soon as water was
poured on them, the seemingly dead one began to show
by a slight oscillation in its extremities that life was not
extinct in it. Fresh water being poured upon it, at the
end of the day it had recovered all its strength and
agility. He afterwards often repeated the same experiment
with a similar result<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>. From this account it appears
that the <i>Gordius</i> or <i>Filaria</i> has a property resembling
that of the <i>Vibrio Tritici</i>, so well described
and so beautifully figured by M. Bauer<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a>, of apparently
dying and being resuscitated by immersion in water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
How long it can retain this property remains to be ascertained.</p>

<p>De Geer states that he had seen them of the length of
two feet<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>; but they vary considerably in this respect. In
ants, in which Gould detected them, he states their
length to be not more than half an inch<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>. In caterpillars,
which they sometimes infest, they are longer; in
that of <i>Notodonta Ziczac</i>, De Geer found one three inches
and a half long<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>; and Rösel three, of six inches, in that of
<i>Deilephila Euphorbiæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>; and in <i>Phalangium cornutum</i>,
according to Latreille, they extend to more than seven
inches<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>. In the larva of a <i>Phryganea</i> L. the author
first named found one which was more than a foot long,
corresponding exactly with the <i>Gordius aquaticus</i> of
Linné; being forked at one extremity, brown above,
gray below, and black at each end<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>. These animals <i>appear</i>
to die as soon as they leave the body<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> they have
preyed upon; except this happens in water, when their
activity has no repose. In this element they give their
bodies every possible inflexion, often tying themselves
in knots in various places, interlacing and twisting themselves
in a hundred different ways; so that when confined
in the body of an insect, from their extreme suppleness
and power of contortion they find sufficient space
wherein to pack their often enormous length<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a>. Linné
makes one of their habitats clay; and Mr. W. S. MacLeay
finds them very common at Putney in clay at the
bottom of pools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Matthey asks&mdash;How does the <i>Gordius</i> get into
<i>Acrida viridissima</i><a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>? And De Geer&mdash;Why do they die
after having quitted a caterpillar? and where do they
perpetuate their species<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a>? These questions, without
further observations, cannot easily be answered. However,
it may be supposed that carnivorous insects, such as
<i>Harpali</i>, &amp;c. may swallow them when found apparently
dead in clay, where the water has been evaporated, or
when they have been ejected by other insects; and they
may revive in their bodies, as Dr. Matthey found them
to do in water. It is not difficult to conjecture that the
larvæ of <i>Phryganeæ</i> may meet with them when young in
the water, and sometimes unluckily swallow them with
their food. Why they become as dead when they emerge
from their prey we cannot at present conjecture; but no
doubt to answer some wise purpose;&mdash;in rainy seasons
they probably revive and get into little hollows full of
rain-water. Upon De Geer's last question&mdash;How they
perpetuate their species&mdash;at present I can offer no conjecture.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XLV" id="LETTER_XLV">LETTER XLV.</a></h2>

<h3><i>SENSES OF INSECTS.</i></h3>


<p>At first one would think that the <i>senses</i> of insects
might be described in very few words, and scarcely afford
matter for a separate letter; but when we find that
physiologists are scarcely yet agreed upon this subject,
and that the use of some of their organs, which appear
to be organs of sensation, has not yet been satisfactorily
ascertained&mdash;we shall not wonder that it requires more
discussion than at the first blush we were aware of. In
treating on this head I shall first say something on the
senses in <i>general</i>, and then confine myself to those of
insects.</p>

<p>Touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight, I need not tell
you, is the usual enumeration of the senses: but as the
term includes every means of communication with the
external world, the list perhaps might be increased; and
there is ground for thinking that the number <i>seven</i>, so
signalized as a <i>sacred</i> number<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>, may also here have
place. Dr. Virey, an eminent physiologist, whose sentiments
on various subjects I have before noticed with
approbation<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>, appears to be of opinion that there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
really <i>seven</i> senses; which he divides into those that
are altogether <i>physical</i>, and those that are more connected
with the <i>intellect</i>. The first of these divisions
contains <i>four</i> senses,&mdash;touch, love, taste, and smell;&mdash;the
second <i>three</i>,&mdash;hearing, sight, and the internal sense
of thought, or the brain<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>. That he is right in adding
<i>love</i> to the list seems to me evident, because it is as
distinct from <i>touch</i>, as <i>smelling</i> and <i>taste</i> are. With regard
to the other, though it may be expected that there
should be a transitive sense connecting the intellect (if I
may so speak) with the external organ of sense, and as
a medium by which the former can receive the notices
of the external world furnished by the latter; yet it seems
improper to make the <i>entire brain</i> itself a <i>sense</i>. We
know that the agent between the common sensory and
the sense is the consciousness or <i>perception</i> of the impression.
"Seeing we may see and not <i>perceive</i>, and
hearing we may hear and not <i>understand</i>." The picture
may be painted upon the retina of the eye, the sound
may strike upon the tympanum of the ear; but neither
the one nor the other be received by the intellect, unless
the internal power or faculty of perception be in action
and mediate between them. This is what I mean by
the <i>internal sense</i>, which, to use a term of Mr. W. S.
MacLeay's<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>, is <i>osculant</i> between intellect and sense, or
forms the transit from one group of powers to the
other.</p>

<p>Of the ordinary senses, <i>sight</i> holds the first rank: it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
can dart to the region of the stars, and convey by the
perceiving sense, to the sensory, ideas of innumerable
objects. Next in rank is <i>hearing</i>, which can receive
sounds from a great distance; but the ideas it remits are
confined only to one object, the variations of tones. In
the other organs the sensitive power is much more confined.
There is another difference between the intellectual
and physical senses:&mdash;the former are the only
ones that receive and convey sensations of the beautiful
and sublime; of harmony and discord,&mdash;the latter, though
they minister more to our sensual enjoyments, add
little to our intellectual; and therefore too devoted an
indulgence in them debases our nature, and levels us
with the brutes, which use their eyes and ears only for
information, not for pleasure<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>.</p>

<p>In man the ordinary five senses are usually in their
greatest perfection, although in some animals particular
senses have a greater range. The Vertebrates in general
are also gifted with the same number, though there are
some exceptions. But in the <i>Invertebrates</i> they are seldom
to be met with all together in the same object. The
<i>Cephalopods</i> have no <i>smell</i>. Several <i>Gasteropods</i> can
neither <i>hear</i> nor <i>see</i>. The animals of bivalve shells have
neither eyes, nor ears, nor smell; and the zoophytes and
the races below them have, it is affirmed, only the single
sense of <i>touch</i>, which in them is so extremely delicate as
to be acted upon even by <i>light</i><a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a>.</p>

<p>Not so our insects. These, there is good reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
believe, possess all the ordinary senses. That they can
<i>see</i>, <i>touch</i>, <i>taste</i>, and <i>smell</i>, no one denies. Linné and
Bonnet, however, thought them deprived of <i>hearing</i><a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>;
but numerous observations prove the contrary. That
they hear in their <i>larva</i> state, is evident from facts stated
by the latter physiologist. He found that the sound of
his voice evidently affected some caterpillars; which he
attributes, but surely without reason, to the delicacy of
their sense of touch: at another time, when some caterpillars
of a different species were moving swiftly, he rang
a small bell; upon which they instantly stopped and
moved the anterior part of their body very briskly<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a>.
That they possess this faculty in their <i>imago</i> state is confirmed
still more strongly by facts. I once was observing
the motions of an <i>Apion</i> under a pocket microscope: on
seeing me it receded. Upon my making a slight but distinct
noise, its antennæ started: I repeated the noise
several times, and invariably with the same effect. A
<i>Harpalus</i>, which I was holding in my hand, answered
the sound in the same manner repeatedly. Flies, I have
observed, at brisk and distinct sounds move all their
legs; and spiders will quit their prey and retire to their
hiding places. Insects that live in society give notice
of intended movements, or assemble their citizens for
emigration by a certain <i>hum</i><a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a>. But the most satisfactory
proof of the hearing of these animals is to be had from
those <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Hemiptera</i> whose males are vocal.
Brunelli kept and fed several males of <i>Acrida viridissima</i>
(a grasshopper with us not uncommon) in a closet, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
were very merry, and continued singing all the day; but
a rap at the door would stop them instantly. By practice
he learned to imitate their chirping: when he did
this at the door, at first a few would answer him in a
low note, and then the whole party would take up the
tune and sing with all their might. He once shut up
a male in his garden, and gave the female her liberty;
but as soon as she heard the male chirp, she flew to him
immediately<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a>.</p>

<p>But although physiologists are for the most part agreed
that insects have the ordinary five senses of vertebrate
animals, yet a great variety of opinions has obtained as
to their external organs; so that it has been matter of
doubt, for instance, whether the <i>antennæ</i> are for smell,
touch, or hearing; and the <i>palpi</i> for smell, taste, or
touch. Nor has the question, as it appears to me, been
satisfactorily decided: for though it is now the most
general opinion that the primary use of antennæ is to
<i>explore</i> as <i>tactors</i>, yet by the most strenuous advocates
of this opinion they are owned not to be <i>universally</i> so
employed; so that granting this to be <i>one</i> of their principal
functions, yet it seems to follow that there may be
<i>another</i> common to them all, which of course would be
their <i>primary</i> function. We are warned, however, not
to lay any stress upon the argument to be drawn from
analogy; and told that we might as well dispute about
the identity of the nose of a man, the proboscis of the
elephant, the horn of the rhinoceros, the crest of the
cock, or the beak of the toucan<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a>. But this is merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
casting dust in our eyes: for though three of these
are <i>nasal</i> organs, bearing <i>nostrils</i>; the two others have
no relation to the question, the horn of the rhinoceros
and the crest of the cock being merely <i>appendages</i>, and
have no more analogy to the nose and nostrils, which
co-exist with them, than they have to the eyes or ears.
I have on a former occasion observed, that a gradual
change sometimes takes place in the functions of particular
organs; but still, generally speaking, this observation
regards <i>secondary</i> functions&mdash;the <i>primary</i> usually
remaining untouched. We may say, for instance, with
regard to the primary use of the <i>legs</i> of animals, that it
is locomotion; while the secondary is either walking,
running, jumping, flying, or swimming, according to the
circumstances and nature of the animal. Thus the <i>fore-legs</i>
of the <i>Mammalia</i>, in <i>birds</i> become <i>wings</i>, and both
pair in <i>fish</i> are changed to <i>fins</i>. Observe, I do not say
<i>always</i> and invariably, but in most cases,&mdash;that analogous
parts have analogous uses, at least as far as <i>primary</i> uses
are concerned. When, therefore, we cannot have demonstrative
evidence concerning the function of an organ
discoverable in any animal, we may often derive satisfactory
probable arguments from the analogies observable
in their structure compared with that of other animals,
concerning the nature of whose organs we have no doubt.
In fact, the chief evidence we have with regard to the
office of the organs of sense in the animals immediately
below ourselves, is that of analogy;&mdash;because <i>we</i> see
with our eyes, hear with our ears, &amp;c., we conclude,
with reason, that <i>they</i> do the same.</p>

<p>In inquiring therefore into what may be the most general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
use of the antennæ of insects, I shall endeavour to
discover whether there is any part in the higher animals
to which they may be deemed to exhibit any analogy.
And here I must refer you to what I have said on a former
occasion upon the present subject; where I made it
evident, I hope, that the great bulk of the parts and organs
of insects, in this particular differing from the majority
of Invertebrates, are, some in one respect, some
in another, and some in many, really analogous to those
of the higher animals<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>; and that a great many of them,
though varying in their structure, have the same functions.
Thus the analogues of the <i>eyes</i> of Vertebrates
are for <i>seeing</i>; of the <i>jaws</i> for <i>masticating</i>; of the <i>lips</i>
for <i>closing</i> the <i>mouth</i>; of the <i>legs</i> for <i>walking</i>, &amp;c. We
have seen also very recently, that a similar analogy, more
or less strongly marked, holds also in their internal organs<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>;
so that it may be safely affirmed, that if all the
invertebrate insects, though gifted with numerous peculiarities,
present the most striking picture of those animals
that have an internal skeleton, and more particularly
of the <i>Mammalia</i>,&mdash;we may assume it as a probability,
the above circumstances being allowed their due
weight, that where facts do not prove the contrary, the
function of analogous organs is more or less synonymous,
though perhaps the structure and <i>modus operandi</i> may
be different.</p>

<p>In the letter lately referred to, I observed that the antennæ
of insects are analogous to <i>ears</i> in Vertebrates<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>.
Their <i>number</i> corresponds; they also stand out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
head; and what has weighed most with me, unless they
are allowed as such, no other organ can have any pretension
to be considered as representing the ear. If we
reflect, that in every other part and organ, the head of
insects has an analogy to that of <i>Mammalia</i>, we must
regard it as improbable that these prominent organs
should not also have their representative. Admitting
then that they are the analogues of ears, it will follow,
not as demonstratively certain, but as probable, that
their <i>primary</i> function may be something related to hearing.
I do not say direct <i>hearing</i>, or that the vibrations
of sound are communicated to the sensorium by a complex
structure analogous to that of the internal ear in
<i>Mammalia</i>&mdash;but something <i>related</i> to hearing. I conceive
that antennæ, by a peculiar structure, may collect
notices from the atmosphere, receive pulses or vibrations,
and communicate them to the sensorium, which,
though not precisely to be called hearing, may answer
the same purpose. From the <i>compound</i> eyes that most
of them have, the sense of seeing in insects must be very
different from what it is in vertebrate animals; and yet
we do not hesitate to call it <i>sight</i>: but since antennæ,
as we shall see, apparently convey a <i>mixed</i> sensation, I
shall have no objection, admitting it as their primary
function, to call it after Lehmann <i>Aëroscepsy</i><a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>. I lately
related some instances of <i>sound</i> producing an effect on
the <i>antennæ</i> of insects: I will now mention another that
I observed, still more remarkable. A little moth was
reposing upon my window; I made a quiet, not loud,
but distinct noise: the antenna nearest to me immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
moved towards me. I repeated the noise at least a dozen
times, and it was followed every time by the same motion
of that organ; till at length the insect being alarmed
became more agitated and violent in its motions. In
this instance it could not be <i>touch</i>; since the antenna
was not applied to a surface, but directed towards the
quarter from which the sound came, as if to listen.
Bonsdorf made similar observations, to which Lehmann
seems not disposed to allow their proper weight<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a>. It
has been used as an argument to prove that antennæ are
primarily <i>tactors</i>, or instruments of <i>touch</i>, that <i>F&#339;nus
Jaculator</i>, before it inserts its ovipositor, plunges its <i>antennæ</i>
into the hole forming the nidus of the bee, to the
grub of which it commits its egg<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>. But had those who
used this argument <i>measured</i> the antennæ and the ovipositor
of this ichneumon, they would have discovered
that the latter is thrice the length of the former: and as
these insects generally insert it so that even part of the
abdomen enters the hole, it is clear that the antenna
cannot <i>touch</i> the larva; its object therefore cannot be to
explore by that sense. Others suppose that by these
organs it <i>scents</i> out the destined nidus for its eggs; but
Lehmann has satisfactorily proved that they are not
<i>olfactory</i> organs. We can therefore only suppose, either
that by means of its antennæ it <i>hears</i> a slight noise produced
by the latent grub, perhaps by the action of its
mandibles; or else that by its motions it generates a <i>motion</i>
in the atmosphere of its habitation, which striking
upon the antennæ of the <i>F&#339;nus</i>, are by them communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
to its sensory. A similar disproportion is observable
between the antennæ and ovipositor of <i>Pimpla
Manifestator</i>, before signalized<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>. Bees, when collecting
honey and pollen, first insert the organs in question into
the flowers which they visit; but, as I have more than
once observed, they merely insert the <i>tip</i> of them. If
anthers are bursting, or the nectar is exuding, these
processes probably are attended by a slight noise, or
motion of the air within the blossom, which, as in the
last case, affects, without immediate contact, the exploring
organs.</p>

<p>If the <i>structure</i> of antennæ be taken into consideration,
it will furnish us with additional reasons in favour of the
above hypothesis, with regard to their primary function.
We shall find that these organs, in most of those insects
which take their food by suction, are usually less gifted
with powers of motion, than they are in the mandibulate
tribes; so that in the majority of the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i>, as is generally acknowledged, they
cannot be used for <i>touch</i>. Under this view, they may
be divided into <i>active</i> antennæ and <i>passive</i> antennæ: of
the former, the <i>most</i> active and versatile are those of the
<i>Hymenoptera</i>. By means of them, as was before observed<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>,
their gregarious tribes hold converse, and make
<i>inquiry</i>&mdash;frequently without <i>contact</i>&mdash;in the pursuit and
discharge, if I may so speak, of the various duties devolved
upon them by <span class="smcap">Providence</span>. Amongst active
antennæ, some are much more <i>complex</i> in their structure
than others&mdash;a circumstance which is often characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of the <i>male</i> insect<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>: but if we examine such antennæ,
we shall find that their most <i>sensitive</i> parts cannot
come in <i>contact</i> with the earth or other bodies for
exploring their way; but having thus a greater surface
exposed to the action of the atmosphere, they have more
points to receive vibrations, or any pulses or other notices
communicated to it. It is thus, probably, that in their
flights, when they approach within a certain distance,
they discover the station of the other sex. Even the
plumose antennæ of male gnats may in some respects
thus be acted upon. In the Lamellicorn beetles, the
knob of these organs in both sexes consists of laminæ,
the external ones on their outside, of a corneous substance;
while their internal surface, and the inner laminæ&mdash;which
are included between them, as an oyster between
the valves of its shell&mdash;are covered with nervous papillæ.
If you examine the proceedings of one of these little
animals, you will find before it moves from a state of
repose that its antennæ emerge, and the laminæ diverge
from each other; but that it does not apply them to <i>surfaces</i>
to explore its way, but merely keeps them <i>open</i> to
receive notices from the atmosphere. Even <i>simple</i> antennæ
are often employed in this way, as well as for
touch. I once noticed a species of <i>Leptocerus</i>, a trichopterous
genus, in which these organs are very long, that
was perched upon a blade of grass; its antennæ vibrated,
and it kept moving them from side to side in the air, as
if thus by aëroscepsy it was inquiring what was passing
around it. Dr. Wollaston has an observation bearing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
precisely upon this question, and in general so extremely
similar to what is here advanced, that I must copy it for
your consideration. "Since there is nothing in the constitution
of the atmosphere," says he, "to prevent vibrations
much more frequent than any of which we are
conscious, we may imagine that animals like the <i>Grylli</i>,
whose powers appear to commence nearly where ours
terminate, may have the faculty of hearing still sharper
sounds, which at present we do not know to exist; and
that there may be other insects, hearing nothing in common
with us, but endued with a power of exciting, and
a sense that perceives, vibrations indeed of the same nature
as those which constitute our ordinary sounds, but
so remote, that the animals who perceive them may be
said <i>to possess another sense, agreeing with our own solely
in the medium by which it is excited</i>, and possibly wholly
unaffected by these slower vibrations of which we are
sensible<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>." That insects, however, hear nothing in common
with us, is contrary to fact; at least with respect
to numbers of them. They hear our sounds, and we
theirs; but their hearing or analogous sense is much
nicer than ours, collecting the slightest vibratiuncle imparted
by other insects, &amp;c. to the air. In inquiring
how this is done, it may be asked&mdash;How know we that
every joint of some antennæ is not an acoustic organ, in
a certain sense distinct from the rest? We see that the
eyes of insects are usually compound, and consist of numerous
distinct lenses;&mdash;why may not their external
ears or their analogues be also multiplied, so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
enable them with more certainty to collect those fine
vibrations that we know reach their sensory, though
they produce no effect upon our grosser organs? I propose
this merely as conjecture, that you may think it
over, and reject or adopt it, in proportion as it appears
to you reasonable or the contrary; and in the hope that
some anatomist of insects, who, to the sagacity and depth
of a Cuvier and a Savigny adds the hand and eye of a
Lyonet, may give to the world the results of a more minute
dissection and fuller investigation of the antennæ
of these animals, than has yet been undertaken.</p>

<p>But besides receiving notices from the atmosphere, of
sounds, and of the approach or proximity of other insects,
&amp;c., the antennæ are probably the organs by which
insects can discover alterations in its state, and foretel
by certain prognostics when a change of weather is approaching.
Bees possess this faculty to an admirable
degree. When engaged in their daily labours, if a
shower is approaching, though we can discern no signs
of it, they foresee it, and return suddenly to their hives.
If they wander far from home, and do not return till
late in the evening, it is a prognostic to be depended
upon, that the following day will be fine: but if they
remain near their habitations, and are seen frequently
going and returning, although no other indication of wet
should be discoverable, clouds will soon arise and rain
come on. Ants also are observed to be excellently
gifted in this respect: though they daily bring out
their larvæ to sun them, they are never overtaken by
sudden showers<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a>. Previously to rain, as you well know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
numberless insects seek the house; then the <i>Stomoxys
calcitrans</i>, leaving more ignoble prey, attacks us in our
apartments, and interrupts our studies and meditations<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a>.
The insects of prey also foresee the approach of wet
weather, and the access of flies, &amp;c. to places of shelter.
Then the spiders issue from their lurking-places, and
the ground-beetles in the evening run about our houses.
Passive antennæ, which are usually furnished with a
terminal or lateral bristle, and plumose and pectinated
ones, seem calculated for the action of the <i>electric</i> and
other fluids dispersed in the atmosphere, which in certain
states and proportions may certainly indicate the
approach of a tempest, or of showers, or a rainy season,
and may so affect these organs as to enable the insect
to make a sure prognostic of any approaching change:
and we know of no other organ that is so likely to have
this power. I say <i>electric</i> fluid, because when the atmosphere
is in a highly electrified state, and a tempest
is approaching, is the time when insects are usually most
abundant in the air, especially towards the evening; and
many species may then be taken, which are not at other
times to be met with: but before the storm comes on,
all disappear, and you will scarcely see a single individual
upon the wing. This seems to indicate that insects
are particularly excited by electricity<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>.&mdash;But upon this
head I wish to make no positive assertion, I only suggest
the probability of the opinion<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a>.</p>

<p>From all that has been said, I think you will be disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
to admit that the primary and most universal
function of the antennæ is to be the organs of a sense, if
not the same, at least analogous to <i>hearing</i>, and answering
the same end; something perhaps between it and
touch. In some, however, as has been found in the
<i>Crustacea</i>, an organ of hearing, in the ordinary sense,
may exist at the base of the antennæ, which may act the
part in some measure of the external ear, and collect
and transmit the sound to such organ<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a>.</p>

<p>That numerous antennæ, as a <i>secondary</i> function, explore
by <i>touch</i>, is admitted on all hands, and therefore I
need not enlarge further upon this point; but shall proceed
to inquire whether insects do not possess some
other peculiar organs that are particularly appropriated
to this sense. First, however, I must make some <i>general</i>
observations upon it. Of all our senses, <i>touch</i> is the
only one that is not <i>confined</i> to particular organs, but
dispersed over the whole body: insects, however, from
the indurated crust with which they are often covered,
feel sensibly, it is probable, only in those parts where
the nerves are exposed, by being covered with a thinner
epidermis, to external action. Not that they cannot feel
at all in their covered parts; for as we feel sufficiently for
walking, though our feet are covered by the thick sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of a boot or shoe, so insects feel sufficiently through the
crust of their legs for all purposes of motion. Besides,
the points that are covered by a thinner cuticle are often
numerous; so that touch, at least in a <i>passive</i> sense, may
be pretty generally dispersed over their bodies; but <i>active</i>
or exploring touch is confined to a few organs, as
the <i>antennæ</i>, the <i>palpi</i>, and the <i>arms</i>. The two last I
shall now discuss.</p>

<p>Various opinions have been started concerning the use
of the <i>palpi</i>. Bonsdorf thought that they were organs
of <i>smell</i>; Knoch, that this sense was confined to the
<i>maxillary</i> ones, and that the <i>labial</i> ones were appropriated
to <i>taste</i><a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a>: but the most early idea, and that from
which they derive their present name of palpi (<i>feelers</i>), is,
that they are organs of active <i>touch</i>; and this seems to me
the most correct and likely opinion. Cuvier, himself a
host, has embraced this side of the question<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>, and Lehmann
also admits it<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>. The following observations tend
to confirm this opinion. The palpi of numerous insects
when they walk, are frequently, or rather without intermission,
applied to the surface on which they are moving&mdash;this
you may easily see by placing one upon your
hand; which seems to indicate that they are <i>feelers</i>. In
the <i>Araneidæ</i> they are used as <i>legs</i>; and by the males
at least, as <i>exciting</i> if they be not really <i>genital</i> organs<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>.
In the <i>Scorpionidæ</i> they answer the purpose of <i>hands</i>:
besides being usually much shorter than antennæ, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
are better calculated to assist an insect in threading the
dark and tortuous labyrinths through which it has often
to grope its way, and where antennæ cannot be employed.
I have noticed that <i>Hydrophili</i>&mdash;in which genus the
<i>palpi</i> are longer than the antennæ&mdash;when they swim,
have their antennæ folded; while the former are stretched
out in front, as exploring before them. As these
are attached to the under-jaws and under-lip, we may
suppose they are particularly useful to insects in taking
their food; and upon this occasion I have often observed
that they are remarkably active. I have seen <i>Byturus
tomentosus</i>, a beetle which feeds upon pollen, employ
them in opening anthers; and the maxillary pair appear
to me to assist the maxillæ in holding the food, while
the mandibles are at work upon it.</p>

<p>The <i>arms</i> or fore-legs of some insects are also organs
of <i>active</i> touch, being used, as we have seen, for cleaning
the head, digging, repairing their dwellings, and the
like<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a>. By the <i>Ephemeræ</i>, which have very short antennæ,
the fore-legs, when they fly, are extended before
the head, parallel with each other and quite united&mdash;probably
to assist in cutting the air. The <i>Trichoptera</i> use
their antennæ for the same purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another sense of which the organ seems uncertain is
that of <i>smelling</i>, and various and conflicting opinions
have been circulated concerning it. Christian thought
that insects smell <i>distant</i> objects with their <i>antennæ</i>, and
<i>near</i> ones with their <i>palpi</i><a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a>. Comparetti has a most singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
opinion. He supposes in different tribes of insects
that different parts are organs of smell: in the <i>Lamellicorns</i>
he conjectures the seat of this sense to reside in the
<i>knob</i> of the <i>antennæ</i>; in the <i>Lepidoptera</i> in the <i>antlia</i>;
and in some <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Orthoptera</i> in certain <i>frontal
cells</i><a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>. At first sight, one of the most reasonable opinions
seems to be that of Baster, adopted by Lehmann,
and which has received the sanction of Cuvier<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a>,&mdash;that
the <i>spiracles</i> are organs of smell as well as of respiration.
Lehmann has adduced several arguments in support of
this opinion. Because we both respire and smell with
our nostrils, he concludes that neither the antennæ nor
any other part of the head of insects can serve for <i>smell</i>,
since they are not the seat also of <i>respiration</i>; and that
there can be no smell where the air is not inspired<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>.
Again, because nerves from the ganglions of the spinal
chord terminate in bronchiæ near the spiracles, they
must be for receiving scents from those openings. Though
it was necessary, in the higher animals, that the organ of
scent should be near the mouth, because they are larger
than their food; yet the reverse of this being the case
with insects, which often even reside in what they eat, it
is to them of no importance where their sense of smelling
resides<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a>. By exposing antennæ, by means of an orifice
in a glass vessel, to the action of stimulant odours, they
appeared quite insensible to it: but he does not name
the result of any experiment in which he exposed the
<i>mouth</i> to this action; nor at all distinctly how the insect
was affected when the spiracles were exposed to it<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>But though some of these arguments appear weighty,
there are others, I think, that will more than counterbalance
them, making it probable that the seat of this sense
is in the head, either in its ordinary station at the extremity
of what I call the <i>nose</i>, between it and the upper-lip,
or under those parts. That the nose corresponds with
the so-named part in <i>Mammalia</i>, both from its situation
and often from its form, must be evident to every one
who looks at an insect<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a>; and when we further consider
the connexion that obtains between the senses of smell and
taste, how necessary it is that the seat of the one should
be near that of the other, and that it really is so in all
animals in which we certainly know its organ<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>; we shall
feel convinced that the argument from analogy is wholly
in favour of the nose, and may thence consider it as probable
that the sense in question does reside there. Lehmann
seems to be of opinion, because an insect is usually
smaller than what it feeds upon, that it makes no difference
whether it smells with its <i>head</i> or with its <i>tail</i>: but
one would think that a <i>flying</i> insect would be more readily
directed to its object by smelling with the <i>anterior</i>
part of the body than with the <i>posterior</i>; and that a <i>feeding</i>
one would also find it more convenient in selecting its
food. As to the argument,&mdash;that <i>smell</i> must be the <i>necessary</i>
concomitant of the <i>respiratory</i> openings, and that
there can be no smell where the <i>air</i> is not inspired,&mdash;this
seems asserting more than our knowledge of these
animals will warrant: for the organs of the <i>other</i> senses,
though the senses themselves seem analogous, are so
different in their structure, and often in the mode in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
which they receive the impressions from external objects,
that analogy would lead us to expect a difference of this
kind also in the sense of smell. Besides, smell does not
<i>invariably</i> accompany respiratory organs even in the
higher animals,&mdash;for we <i>breathe</i> with our <i>mouths</i>, but do
not smell with them. Cuvier says that the <i>internal</i> membrane
of the tracheæ being soft and moist, appears calculated
to receive scents<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>. But here his memory failed
him; for it is the <i>external</i> membrane alone that answers
this description; the <i>internal</i> consisting of a spiral elastic
thread, and seeming not at all fitted to receive impressions,
but merely to convey the air<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a>. That nerves penetrate
to the bronchiæ, does not necessarily imply that they are
connected with the sense in question, since this may be
to act upon the muscles which are every where distributed.</p>

<p>I shall now state some facts that seem to prove that
scents are received by some organ in the vicinity of the
<i>mouth</i>, and probably connected with the <i>nose</i>. M. P. Huber,
desirous of ascertaining the seat of smell in <i>bees</i>,
tried the following experiments with that view. These
animals, of all ill scents, abominate most that of the oil
of turpentine. He presented successively to all the
points of a bee's body, a hair-pencil saturated with it: but
whether he presented it to the abdomen, the trunk, or
the head, the animal equally disregarded it. Next,
using a very fine hair-pencil, while the bee had extended
its proboscis, he presented the pencil to it, to the eyes
and antennæ, without producing any effect; but when he
pointed it <i>near the cavity of the mouth, above the insertion</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
<i>of the proboscis</i>, the creature started back in an instant,
quitted its food, clapped its wings, and walked about in
great agitation, and would have taken flight if the pencil
had not been removed. On this, it began to eat again;
but on the experiment being repeated, showed similar
signs of discomposure: oil of marjoram produced the
same effect, but more promptly and certainly. Bees not
engaged in <i>feeding</i> appeared more sensible of the impression
of this odour, and at a greater distance; but those
engaged in absorbing honey might be touched in every
other part without being disturbed. He seized several
of them, forced them to unfold their proboscis, and then
stopped their mouth with paste. When this was become
sufficiently dry to prevent their getting rid of it, he restored
to them their liberty: they appeared not incommoded
by being thus gagged, but moved and respired
as readily as their companions. He then tempted them
with honey, and presented to them near the mouth, oil
of turpentine, and other odours that they usually have
an aversion to; but all produced no sensible effect upon
them, and they even walked upon the pencils saturated
with them<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a>.</p>

<p>These experiments incontestibly prove that the organ
of scent in bees&mdash;and there is no reason to think that
other insects do not follow the same law&mdash;is in or near
the <i>mouth</i>, and above the proboscis. It remains, therefore,
that we endeavour to discover its <i>precise</i> situation:
and as insects cannot tell us, nor can we perceive by
their actions, in what precise part the sense in question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
resides, the only modes to which we can have recourse to
form any probable conjecture, are analogy and dissection.
At first, the opinion noticed above, that the palpi are its
organs, seems not altogether unreasonable; but as the
argument from analogy, except as to their situation near
the mouth, is not in favour of them, and there seems no
call, were smell their function, for the numerous variations
observable in their structure, I think we must consider
them, as I have endeavoured to prove, rather as instruments
of touch. Let us now inquire, whether there be
not discoverable upon dissection, in the interior of the
head of any insects, some organ that may be deemed,
from its situation, under what we have called the nose
and nostrils, the seat of the sense we are treating of.
The common burying-beetle (<i>Necrophorus Vespillo</i>) is
an insect remarkable for its acuteness of smell, which
enables it to scent out and bury, as was formerly related
to you<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a>, the carcases of small animals. Take one of
these insects, and kill it as formerly directed,&mdash;examine
first its nose: in the middle of the anterior part you will
see a subtrapezoidal space, as it were cut out and filled
with a paler piece of a softer and more membranous texture.
Next divide the head horizontally; and under the
nose, and partly under this space, which I call the <i>rhinarium</i>
or nostril-piece<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>, you will find a pair of circular
pulpy cushions, covered by a membrane transversely
striated with beautifully fine striæ. <i>These</i> are what I
take to be the organs of smell, and they still remain distinctly
visible in a specimen I have had by me more
than fifteen years. A similar organ may be discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
in the common water-beetle (<i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>), but
with this peculiarity, that it is furnished with a pair of
<i>nipples</i>. I have before described an analogous part covered
with papillæ, in <i>Æshna viatica</i>, and you will find
it in other insects<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>. Perhaps at first this part may seem
merely a continuation of the palate; but if you consider
the peculiarities in its structure just noticed, it is evidently
a sensiferous organ; and as the sense of smell appears
to reside in the head, this is its most probable seat.
But by what channel scents act upon it,&mdash;whether they
are transmitted through the pores of the part representing
the nostrils, or received by the mouth,&mdash;I will not
venture to assert positively: but from the circumstance
of their being <i>membranous</i> in some insects remarkable
for acute scent, as in <i>Necrophorus</i>, <i>Staphylinus</i>, &amp;c., there
seems some ground for the <i>former</i> opinion, which receives
further confirmation from an observation of an
eminent Comparative Anatomist, M. Carus, with respect
to <i>Acrida verrucivora</i>, in which under the <i>nose</i> and
<i>rhinarium</i>, as appears from his description, he found
some tracheæ, and two lobes of the cerebral ganglion,
which caused him to regard this as the seat of the sense
of smell<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>. He also tells us that Rosenthal, in the blue-bottle-fly
(<i>Musca vomitoria</i>) places the sense of smell
partly in a delicately folded membrane observable in its
head<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>. As the sense of smell in these little beings is extremely
acute, as well as their hearing, the perception of
odours may reach their sensory through the above pores;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and even those in the hard rhinarium of an <i>Anoplognathus</i>
may receive and transmit them; and besides the
upper-lip and nose are often united by membrane, perhaps
representing the <i>rhinarium</i>, as in <i>Goerius</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> which
may facilitate such transmission.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That insects <i>taste</i>, no one hesitates to believe, though
some have supposed the palpi to be the organ of that
sense; but as they have a <i>tongue</i>, as we have shown, we
may with Cuvier conclude, that one of its primary functions
is to <i>taste</i> their food<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>. I shall not therefore launch
out further upon this head.</p>

<p>I have now placed before you a picture, or rather
sketch, of the insect world. And whether we regard their
general history and economy, their singular metamorphoses,
the infinite varieties and multiplicity of their
structure both external and internal, and their diversified
organs both of sense and motion&mdash;I think you will
be disposed to own, that in no part of his works is the
hand of an <span class="smcap">Almighty</span> and <span class="smcap">All-wise Creator</span> more visibly
displayed, than in these minutiæ of creation; that
they are equally worthy of the attention and study of the
Christian Philosopher with any of the higher departments
of the animal kingdom; and that all praise is due
to Him, for placing before our eyes, for our entertainment
and instruction, such a beautiful moving picture of
little symbols and agents, perpetually reflecting his glory
and working his will.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XLVI" id="LETTER_XLVI">LETTER XLVI.</a></h2>

<h3><i>ORISMOLOGY, OR EXPLANATION OF
TERMS.</i></h3>


<p>It was by the language of <i>terms</i> that he invented and
employed, as well as by his system and methods of arrangement,
that Linné smoothed the way to the study of
Natural History;&mdash;having therefore led you through a
large portion of the <i>flowery</i> fields of the Science of Entomology,
I must now conduct you into that <i>arid</i> but not
barren or unprofitable region. To enable you to understand
descriptions of insects, or to describe them yourself,
you must have a knowledge of the <i>technical</i> language
by which their parts and characters are expressed.
Much of this you already know from the definitions of
external parts, furnished in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a>: I shall
now give you a more full and general explanation of
terms, adding many new ones for unnoticed characters,
that may be conveniently employed.</p>

<p>The science of terms, which I shall call <i>Orismology</i><a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>,
may be divided into <i>two</i> branches&mdash;<i>General</i> Orismology,
and <i>Partial</i> Orismology; the first containing <i>general</i> definitions,
and the last those relating to <i>particular</i> parts
and organs.</p>

<p class="center"><i>GENERAL RULES.</i></p>

<p>In the above tables no notice is taken of diminutives,
compounds, and similar terms, because it seemed best,
with respect to these, to lay down only some general
rules which may include the whole.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rule</span> I.</p>

<p>Terms in English ending in <i>cle</i>, <i>ule</i>, or <i>let</i>, and which
in Latin add <i>lus</i>, <i>la</i>, or <i>lum</i>, to a word, <i>diminish</i> its sense.
As, Denti<i>cle</i>, a little tooth; Set<i>ule</i>, a little bristle; Eye<i>let</i>,
a small eye: Denticu<i>lus</i>, a little dens; Guttu<i>la</i>, a little
gutta; Punctu<i>lum</i>, a little punctum. N.B. Where length
or breadth are concerned, the diminutive implies a diminution
in the length of the predicate. As, Lineo<i>la</i>,
Lineo<i>let</i>, a short line; Strio<i>la</i>, Strio<i>let</i>, a short stria;
Fascio<i>la</i>, Fascio<i>let</i>, a short fascia.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rule</span> II.</p>

<p>The preposition <i>sub</i> prefixed to any word <i>reduces</i> the
sense of it. As, <i>Sub</i>punctate, not fully punctate; <i>Sub</i>hirsute,
not fully hirsute, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rule</span> III.</p>

<p>The termination <i>culus</i> in Latin words added to a comparative
implies the state of the object comparatively.
As, Convexius<i>culus</i>, rather convex than not; Majus<i>culus</i>,
rather large than not. This is usually denoted in
English by the termination <i>ish</i>, or the adverb <i>rather</i>;
as, larg<i>ish</i>, <i>rather</i> large, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rule</span> IV.</p>

<p>The participle present used instead of the adjective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
implies a <i>tendency</i> to the quality expressed by it. As,
<i>Cinerascens</i>, cinerascent, tending to cinereous, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rule</span> V.</p>

<p>The preposition <i>ob</i> prefixed to a term reverses it.
As, <i>Ob</i>conical, <i>Ob</i>cordate, a conical or heart-shaped
body, of which the narrowest part is the base.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rule</span> VI.</p>

<p>In compound terms the <i>last</i> member indicates the
<i>preponderating</i> character. For instance, when it is said
of a body that it is <i>nigro-æneous</i>, it means that the æneous
tint prevails: but if, <i>vice versâ</i>, it is termed <i>æneo-nigrous</i>,
the black tint is predominant.&mdash;N.B. In Sculpture the
terms punctato-striate, or punctato-sulcate, signify that
striæ or furrows are drawn with puncta in them.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Exception</i> 1.</p>

<p>Some compound terms only indicate the union of two
characters in one subject. As, when we say of wings
that they are cruciato-incumbent, we mean both that
they cross each other and are incumbent upon the body.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Exception</i> 2.</p>

<p>Compound terms are sometimes employed very conveniently
to restrict the application of a character to
particular circumstances. As, when we say hirsuto-cinereous,
we mean that the hirsuties only of a body
is cinereous.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rule</span> VII.</p>

<p>When the term ordinary (<i>ordinarius</i>) is added either
to terms expressing impressed puncta, lines, spots, &amp;c.,
it signifies that such puncta, lines, or spots are common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
to a particular section in any genus or tribe. As, the
impressed lateral puncta on the thorax of <i>Scarabæidæ</i>;
the lateral furrows and dorsal channel in the ground
beetles (<i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i>), and the spots in the primary wings
of <i>Xylina Polyodon</i> and affinities<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>.</p>

<h3><i>SYSTEM OF INSECTS.</i></h3>


<p>Having considered insects as to their History, Anatomy
and Physiology, we must next enter a new and
ample field, in which, like most of our predecessors, we
shall often be perplexed and bewildered by the infinite
variety of devious paths which traverse it, and by the
mazy labyrinths in which the more we wander the less
ground we seem to gain.&mdash;You will easily perceive I am
speaking of the <i>System of Insects</i>. System is a subject
which has engaged the attention of Naturalists from the
time of Aristotle to the present day; and even now that
it has been so much and so ably discussed, they are far
from being agreed concerning it. In our own country
a clue has, however, of late been furnished, which upon
the whole seems better calculated to enable us to thread
the intricate labyrinth of nature, than any thing previously
excogitated.</p>

<p>There are two words relating to this subject concerning
which Naturalists seem not to have very precise ideas&mdash;<i>Method</i>
and <i>System</i>. They have often been confounded
and used indifferently to signify the same thing. Thus
we hear of a Natural Method and a Natural System.
Linné seems to have regarded the <i>former</i> of these terms
as representing the actual disposition of objects in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
nature<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>, while by <i>System</i> he understands their classification
and arrangement by Naturalists<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>. But if we consider
their real meaning,&mdash;a <i>Method</i> should signify an
<i>Artificial</i>, and a <i>System</i> a <i>Natural</i> arrangement of objects<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>.
As many systematists, however, have aimed at
giving a <i>natural</i> arrangement, though with various success,&mdash;some,
as the French school, (to which we are
principally indebted for the progress already made,) approximating
nearer to the true idea than others,&mdash;and
none having a <i>perfect</i> conception of it, of which probably
in our present state, our minds, from its intricacy, are incapable,&mdash;it
might perhaps be as well to call every arrangement
whose object is confessedly artificial, a <i>Method</i>;
and that which aims at the plan of nature, a <i>System</i>.
Under this view system-makers would be divided
into two classes,&mdash;the <i>Methodists</i> and <i>Systematists</i>.</p>

<p>The system of nature, which we are now to consider,
may be viewed under a double aspect; for with regard
to all created objects there is a <i>System</i> of <i>Distribution</i>,
and a <i>System</i> of <i>Correlation</i>, which appear to be quite
independent of each other. The former will best fall under
our notice when we are treating of the <i>Geography</i>
of insects: I shall therefore now confine myself to the
latter.</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Almighty Creator</span> willed to bring into
existence this mundane system, he formed it according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
to a preconcerted plan, with all its parts beautifully linked
together and mutually corresponding. All things
were ordered in <i>measure</i>, and <i>number</i>, and <i>weight</i><a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>.
There was nothing deficient, nothing superfluous; but
the whole in the strictest sense "was very good<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>," and
calculated in the highest degree to answer the purpose
of its <span class="smcap">Great Author</span>. I call it a system of <i>Correlation</i>,
because there is discernible in it, in the first place, a concatenation
of its parts, by which, as to their forms and
uses, objects are linked together in groups by a chain of
affinities; so that we pass from one to the other by gentle
gradations, without having to overleap any <i>wide</i> interval.
We see also a gradual ascent from low to high,
from less to more excellent. And this leads us to another
kind of relationship between natural objects, by
which, though placed in distinct groups or in a different
series, they in some sort represent and symbolize each
other. Examples of this relationship by analogy are to
be found in every kingdom of nature, and often form an
ascending series from the lowest to the highest; for, as
we shall see hereafter, these resemblances appear to
maintain a certain correspondence with each other as to
their relative situations; so that, for instance, in the animal
kingdom they ascend step by step, without being
linked by affinity or having any real juxtaposition, from
the lowest groups, towards man, who stands alone at the
head, or in the centre of all.&mdash;I shall say something on
each of these kinds of relationship.</p>

<p>I. The relation of <i>affinity</i> may be considered as to its
<i>series</i> and <i>groups</i>. A series, of course, consists of parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
either <i>concatenated</i> like a chain, or placed <i>separately</i> at
small intervals from each other. It may run either in a
right line, or deviate from it in various ways. It appears
to be the opinion of most modern Physiologists, that the
series of affinities in nature is a <i>concatenated</i> or continuous
series; and that though an <i>hiatus</i> is here and
there observable, this has been caused either by the annihilation
of some original group or species in consequence
of some great convulsion of nature, or that the
objects required to fill it up are still in existence but
have not yet been discovered<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>: and this opinion is founded
on a <i>dictum</i> of Linné, <i>Natura ... saltus non facit</i><a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>. If
this dictum be liberally interpreted, according to the
evident meaning of the word <i>saltus</i>, few will be disposed
to object to it; since both observation and analogy combine
to prove that there must be a regular approximation
of things to each other in the works of God; and
that could we see the whole according to his original
plan, we should find no <i>violent</i> interval to break up that
approximation: but if it be contended, that in this plan
there is no difference in the juxtaposition of the nearest
groups or individuals, and never any interval between
them, I think we are going further than either observation
or analogy will warrant. Were this really and
strictly the case, it seems to follow that every group or
individual species must on one side borrow half its characters
from the <i>preceding</i> group or species, and on the
other impart half to the <i>succeeding</i><a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>. But one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
most evident laws of creation is <i>variety</i>; and if we survey
all the works of the <span class="smcap">Most High</span>, we shall no where discover
that kind of order and symmetry that this strict
interpretation implies. The general march of nature
therefore seems to say, that there must be <i>varying</i> though
not <i>violent</i> intervals in the series of beings: or in other
words, some <i>conterminous</i> species or groups have more
characters in common than others.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of Bonnet (in this field himself a
host) and many other Naturalists, that the series of beings
was not only continuous, but <i>undeviating</i>, ascending
in a <i>direct</i> line from the lowest to the highest<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>. Others,
finding that this theory could not be made to accord
with the actual state of things in nature, thought that a
scale of the kingdoms of nature must represent a <i>map</i> or
<i>net</i><a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a>; thus abandoning a continuous series: and Lamarck,
as was before observed<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>, for the solution of the difficulty,
arranged Invertebrate animals in a double subramose
one. Mr. W. S. MacLeay and (without consultation
nearly at the same time) Professor Agardh, Mr. Fries,
&amp;c. have given to the learned world an opinion which
approximates more nearly to what we see in nature: viz.
That the arrangement of objects is indeed in a continuous
series, but which in its progress forms various convolutions,
each of which may be represented by a <i>circle</i>,
or a series that returns into itself<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a>. According to this
opinion,&mdash;which seems the most consistent of any yet
advanced, and which reconciles facts which upon no
other plan can be reconciled,&mdash;the series of beings is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
involved in the highest degree, rolling wheel within wheel
<i>ad infinitum</i>, and revolving, if I may so speak, round its
centre and summit&mdash;<i>man</i><a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>: who, though not including
in himself all that distinguishes them, is still the great
Archetype in which they terminate, and from which
they degrade on all sides.</p>

<p>It is by this convolving series that the various <i>groups</i>
into which the kingdoms of nature seem resolvable are
formed. We are instructed by the highest authority
that every thing was created "after its kind;" and the
common sense of mankind in all ages has imposed classic,
generic, and other names implying sections, as well as
specific ones, upon natural objects: and though many
modern Physiologists have asserted that species form the
only <i>absolute</i> division in nature; yet as all seem to allow
that there are <i>groups</i>, and many that these are represented
by a circle or group returning into itself<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a>, the
most absolute division in nature, we will not contend
for a term<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>. We now come to consider these groups
themselves, and may notice them under various denominations.</p>

<p>It is customary to consider all the substances of which
our globe consists as divided into <i>three</i> kingdoms,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
<i>Mineral</i>, <i>Vegetable</i>, and <i>Animal</i>; but strictly speaking
the <i>primary</i> division is into organized and inorganized
matter; the former resolving itself into the two kingdoms
last mentioned. These, like England and Scotland
of old, have their "Land Debateable;" occupied
by those <i>Productions moyennes</i>, (to use a term of Bonnet's<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>,)
which are as it were partly animal and partly
vegetable. From this territory common to both, the two
kingdoms are extended in a nearly parallel direction till
they reach their extreme limits, without any incursion
from either side upon their mutual boundaries, but each
showing its kindred with the other by certain resemblances
observable between <i>opposite</i> points; so that valley
corresponds with valley, mountain with mountain, river
with river, sea with sea<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>; not, however, so as to form an
exact counterpart, but only in some general features.
But to leave metaphor;&mdash;as the vegetable kingdom is
distinguished from the mineral by its organization and
life, by its circulation of sap, and by its powers of reproduction
by seed or otherwise; so is the animal from the
vegetable by its powers of volition and locomotion<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a>, by
its nervous systems and organs of sensation, and the
senses to which they minister, by its muscular irritability,
and by its instinctive endowments.</p>

<p>Having made these observations with regard to the primary
division of natural objects in general,&mdash;what I have
further to say will be confined to the <i>animal</i> kingdom,
and ultimately to the branch of which we are treating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>i. Lamarck divided the animal kingdom into two <i>provinces</i>,
or <i>subkingdoms</i> as they are now called; the one
consisting of all those animals whose skeleton is <i>internal</i>
and built upon a vertebral column, which are denominated
<i>Vertebrates</i>; and the second, of those whose skeleton
or its representative is for the most part <i>external</i>,
including the muscles,&mdash;these are called <i>Invertebrates</i><a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a>.
Though this distinction is so marked as in general to
form a most striking characteristic, yet when these two
provinces approach each other, it begins to disappear.
Thus the vertebral column, forming one piece with
the shell<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>, becomes almost <i>external</i> in the Chelonian
reptiles, or tortoises and turtles, and almost disappears
in the cyclostomous fishes; and there is the beginning
of an <i>internal</i> one in the <i>Cephalopoda</i>, or cuttle-fish belonging
to the Invertebrates. Dr. Virey, assuming the
nervous system as his basis, long since divided the animal
kingdom, without assigning names to them, into
<i>three</i> subkingdoms<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>; M. Cuvier has <i>four</i>&mdash;<i>Vertebrata</i>;
<i>Mollusca</i>; <i>Articulata</i>; <i>Radiata</i><a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>: and Mr. MacLeay,
finding <i>five</i> variations of that system, divides animals
into <i>five</i> provinces or subkingdoms, of which I formerly
gave you some account<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>;&mdash;viz. <i>Vertebrata</i>, in which the
nervous system has only one principal centre; <i>Annulosa</i>,
in which it is ganglionic, with the ganglions arranged
in a series, with a double spinal chord; <i>Mollusca</i>, in
which it is ganglionic, with the ganglions dispersed irregularly
but connected by nervous threads; <i>Radiata</i>, in
which it is <i>filamentous</i>, with the nervous threads radiating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
from the mouth; and <i>Acrita</i>, in which this system is
<i>molecular</i><a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>. And to this division of the kingdom, as
founded on a satisfactory basis, I should recommend you
to adhere: still however we may speak of vertebrate and
invertebrate animals, as forming the <i>primary</i> subdivision
of them, taken from a striking character and obvious to
every one who sees them.</p>

<p>If you inquire into the rank of each of these subkingdoms,
of course you will assign the principal station to
the <i>Vertebrates</i>, which are the most perfectly organized,
to which <i>man</i> belongs, and over which he immediately
presides. If we form the scale according to the nervous
system of each province, that in which the organ of
sensation and intellect is most concentrated will stand
first; and in proportion as this organ is multiplied and
dispersed will be the station of the rest, which will place
them in the order in which I have mentioned them; and
the <i>Annulosa</i>, to which insects belong, will precede the
<i>Mollusca</i>, which Cuvier and Lamarck had placed before
them on account of their system of circulation. But
when we reflect that a <i>heart</i> and <i>circulation</i> occur in some
of the conglomerate <i>Polypi</i><a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>, animals that approach the
<i>vegetable</i> kingdom; that some of the acephalous <i>Mollusca</i>
have no visible organs of sense, except that of taste,
whose substance is little better than a homogeneous gelatinous
pulp, and who seem from their inert nature to
have very slight powers of voluntary motion<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>, we shall
be convinced that a heart and circulation alone, unaccompanied
by a more concentrated nervous system and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
perfect structure, cannot place an animal above those
which in every other respect so obviously excel them.
With regard to <i>insects</i> particularly, we may further ask&mdash;Who
that considers how man employs his powers and
organs even in his most degraded state, or that contemplates
the wonderful works that he is enabled to accomplish
when his faculties receive their due cultivation and
direction, can avoid regarding him as superior to the
rest of the animal creation? And what unsophisticated
mind, not entangled in the trammels of system, when it
surveys the industry, the various proceedings, and almost
miraculous works that have been laid before you, the
waxen palaces of the bee,&mdash;the paper cottages of the
wasp and hornet,&mdash;the crowded metropolis of the white
ants,&mdash;the arts, the manufactures, and stratagems of
other insects,&mdash;the associations and labours for the common
good of those that are gregarious;&mdash;will not at once
conclude that they must be a superior race to the slug,
the snail, and others, which live only to eat and propagate
their kind?</p>

<p>Or who, that considers the wonderful structure of
the animals whose cause I advocate,&mdash;the analogy that
exists between their organs of manducation, of motion,
and of sensation, and between various other parts of it<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a>,
with those of the higher animals,&mdash;the acuteness of their
senses, their wonderful strength of muscle<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>, and powers
of locomotion<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>,&mdash;but will think them superior to the headless
and almost inanimate oyster or muscle, or the conglomerate
<i>Alcyonia</i>, though they have a heart and circulation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>Who again, that observes that in proportion as pedate
animals approach to the human type, their motions
are accomplished by fewer organs,&mdash;that man walks <i>ore
sublimi</i> upon <i>two</i> legs; the majority of quadrupeds upon
<i>four</i>; insects upon <i>six</i>: the <i>Arachnida</i> apparently upon
<i>eight</i>; most <i>Crustacea</i> upon <i>ten</i>; and the <i>Myriapods</i> and
others upon <i>many</i>,&mdash;but will thence conclude that insects
must precede the <i>Arachnida</i> and <i>Crustacea</i>?</p>

<p>Who, once more, that reflects that if any of the superior
animals are deprived of a limb it can never be reproduced,
and that in insects the same circumstance occurs;
while spiders and <i>Crustacea</i> if they lose a leg have
the power of reproducing it, and the <i>Mollusca</i> if they are
decapitated can gain a new head,&mdash;will consent to their
being placed after any of these animals<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>?</p>

<p>Lastly, who that recollects that the <i>Mollusca</i> are hermaphrodites,
like most plants, bearing both male and
female organs in the same body,&mdash;but will allow that insects,
in which the sexes are separate as in the Vertebrates,
must be more perfect, and of a higher grade<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a>?</p>

<p>ii. We now come to the <i>Classes</i> into which the <i>Annulosa</i>
are divided. This term appears first to have been employed
by Tournefort, and was adopted by Linné<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>. As
the nervous system of animals furnishes the most prominent
distinction of a subkingdom, so the <i>circulation</i> of
their fluids, and their <i>respiration</i> necessarily connected
with it, seems best to point out the <i>classes</i> into which it
may next be resolved. But having fully explained my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
ideas on this subject in a former letter, I need not here
repeat what I then said<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>.</p>

<p>iii. As we have subkingdoms, so we may also have <i>subclasses</i>,
or such large divisions of a class&mdash;not founded upon
internal organization or any of the primary vital functions,
but upon different modes of taking their food, or
such other <i>secondary</i> characters&mdash;as include more than
one <i>Order</i>. To this description Clairville's <i>Mandibulata</i>
and <i>Haustellata</i> appear to me to belong, which I think
are by no means entitled to the rank of Classes; for
whoever compares these two tribes together will at the
first glance be convinced, by the numerous characters
they possess in common, notwithstanding the different
mode in which they take their food, that they form one
connected primary group. This circumstance, therefore,
only furnishes a clue for their further subdivision into
two secondary groups, separated by distinctions certainly
of a lower value than those which separate the <i>Crustacea</i>
and <i>Arachnida</i> from <i>Insecta</i>. This is further confirmed
by the variations that take place in their mode of feeding
in their different states; some from masticators becoming
suctorious (<i>Lepidoptera</i>), and others from being
suctorious becoming masticators (<i>Myrmeleon</i>, <i>Dytiscus</i>,
&amp;c.),&mdash;which shows that this character does not enter the
essential idea of the animal.</p>

<p>iv. Next to Classes and Subclasses we are to consider
those groups of insects that are denominated <i>Orders</i>.
The characters of these at first were taken principally
from the instruments of flight or the absence of them;
and the name appropriated to each Order by Linné, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Aristotle, had reference to this circumstance. But this
alone does not afford characters sufficiently discriminating:
for though to an accurate observer a difference in
these organs appears to be characteristic of most of the
Orders, yet in some it is not easily detected or defined.
In the <i>Neuroptera</i> there are as many different types of
wings as there are of tribes or suborders. So that it
seems not possible so to construct the definition of every
Order, as to take its character from the organs of flight
alone. Linné was sensible of this, and was compelled
to have recourse to subsidiary characters in the majority
of his: his observation therefore with regard to <i>Genera</i>,&mdash;that
the character does not give the genus, but the
genus the character<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>,&mdash;applies equally to <i>Orders</i>; and the
characters included in the definition of an Order, should
be the result of a careful examination of its component
groups.</p>

<p>On a former occasion I named to you the Orders into
which it appeared to me the Class <i>Insecta</i> might be divided<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>;
they were these. <i>Coleoptera</i>; <i>Strepsiptera</i>;
<i>Dermaptera</i>; <i>Orthoptera</i>; <i>Hemiptera</i>; <i>Trichoptera</i>;
<i>Lepidoptera</i>; <i>Neuroptera</i>; <i>Hymenoptera</i>; <i>Diptera</i>:
<i>Aphaniptera</i>; <i>Aptera</i>. I then briefly explained them
merely for the sake of illustration, and that you might
know what description of insects were meant when
these Orders were mentioned in my letters, without intending
to affirm that I had arranged them in a natural
series, or that all of them were perfectly natural. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
now consider them separately, and conclude with giving
my sentiments as to which should be placed first.</p>


<p class="center">* <i><span class="smcap">orders</span> in which the ordinary Trophi all occur, or the</i>
Mouth <i>is</i> perfect<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a>. (<i>Mandibulata.</i>)</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Coleoptera</span><a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> (<i>Eleutherata</i> F.). Aristotle may be
called the founder of this Order, since he both named
and defined it<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>. Both his name and definition were
adopted by Linné; and the former (with the exception
of Fabricius and his school) by all succeeding Entomologists.
To his definition <i>Wings in a sheath</i><a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>, other
characters have been added; as the folding of the wings,
and the straight suture by which the elytra are united<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>.
Aristotle's character, though to be found in the great
majority of the Order, is not universal, since there are
some beetles that have neither wings nor sheath, as the
female glow-worm; and many that though they have the
sheath have no wings, as <i>Meloe</i>, many <i>Carabi</i>, &amp;c. To
the transverse folding of the wings there are also exceptions;
as in <i>Buprestis</i>, <i>Molorchus</i>, &amp;c. The straight suture
by which one elytrum exactly coincides with the
other without lapping over, fails in <i>Meloe</i>: so that no one
of these characters can be called universal in the Order;
but as an exception or two does not invalidate a rule,
and these are sufficiently universal for the purpose of
pointing it out, they may be retained. Perhaps it will
be an improvement to add the kind of the <i>metamorphosis</i>,

improper, and which ought to have been retained. Its
present name was, I believe, assigned to it by Olivier;
and as this is generally in use, I shall not attempt to disturb
it. Dr. Leach divided the Order into two, separating

He was led to this by the tegmina decussating

the horizontal portion of one tegmen lies longitudinally
over that of the other; he also probably took their depressed

the Linnean Orders this appears to consist of the most
discordant tribes; so that it seems next to impossible to
construct a definition that will include them all, unless
indeed we admit M. Latreille's idea, adopted by Mr.
MacLeay<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>, that a varied metamorphosis is its essential
character; or, to speak more largely, variety itself seems
the characteristic of the insects composing it, in every
state; and there is scarcely a common distinctive character
in their perfect state, upon detecting which in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
individual you may exclaim&mdash;This is a Neuropterous insect.
The only one that I have been enabled to seize is, that

obliquely<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>. Whether, with all this puzzling variation
and dissonance between the different tribes of which it
is now composed, this Order can be considered as a natural
group, in the present state of our knowledge it
would be rash to decide. I shall observe, however, that
the <i>Libellulina</i>,&mdash;whether we regard their metamorphosis
and the singular character before described that distinguishes
their larva and pupa<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>, their oral instruments<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>,

I shall consider it as not further divisible, and as consisting
of five principal forms. I must not omit to observe,
that in the <i>Ephemerina</i> the parts of the mouth, except
the labrum and palpi, appear to be mere rudiments<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>.</p>

<i>Sirex</i> L. as being osculant between the Order we
are now entering upon and the <i>Trichoptera</i>, and <i>Tenthredo</i>,
L. as belonging to the latter. He appears to
ground this opinion chiefly upon a consideration of their
larvæ and a slight difference in their ovipositor. As the
Order, as settled by Linné, has always been deemed one
of the most natural ones, and all the great Entomologists
of the present æra have agreed with him in thinking
it so; it seems to me that to prove them mistaken in this
opinion, the question should have been discussed at more
length, and that it requires arguments of more weight
than any Mr. MacLeay has at present produced to set it
aside. He appears in general to lay great stress upon
an agreement in larvæ and the kind of metamorphosis;
and I am ready to acknowledge that it forms a strong
<i>presumption</i> in favour of any hypothesis of affinity between
certain tribes. But when it is had recourse to as
fundamental and infallible, I think it is pushed far beyond
what it will bear, or is warrantable. I may be
wrong; but in my apprehension, a striking agreement
in their general structure in the <i>perfect</i> state, which is
the acme of their nature, affords a much more satisfactory
reason for keeping two tribes together, than any
difference observable in their larvæ or metamorphosis,
for separating them. Let any one compare the structure
of these two tribes with the <i>Trichoptera</i> on one side, and
the <i>Hymenoptera</i> on the other, and it will require but
a glance to convince him of their greater affinity to the
latter; and the simple inspection only of Jurine's plates
of the wings of <i>Hymenoptera</i> is calculated to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
the same effect. With regard to their <i>larvæ</i>, the resemblance
between the case-worms and the pseudo-caterpillars
of the saw-flies seems to me very distant, and
the numerous prolegs of the latter have scarcely a
legitimate representative in the former. The larvæ of
the genus <i>Lyda</i> lose the prolegs intirely, and in one
species, which much resembles the vermiform larvæ of
<i>Hymenoptera</i>, the real legs are so extremely short as to
be scarcely discernible<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a>; so that it requires no great
stretch of faith to believe that saw-flies or <i>Sirices</i> may
exist in whose larvæ the legs disappear<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>. But it is this
very tribe, whose larvæ thus approach to those of the
other <i>Hymenoptera</i>, in which Mr. MacLeay finds the
greatest external resemblance to the <i>Trichoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a>. In
fact the difference between the saw-flies and <i>Siricidæ</i>,
and the remainder of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, amounts to little
more than what takes place in the <i>Diptera</i> Order between
the <i>Tipulidæ</i>, <i>Asilidæ</i>, <i>Muscidæ</i>, &amp;c., in which
also the <i>metamorphosis</i> differs.</p>

<p>Another argument upon which Mr. MacLeay seems
to lay some stress, is taken from the number of parts
into which the <i>ovipositor</i> of the saw-flies is resolvable,
which he finds to consist of <i>four</i> pieces; while in what he
considers as the genuine <i>Hymenoptera</i>, it is formed only
of <i>three</i><a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>: but in fact, in these last there are <i>two</i> spiculæ,
answering to the two saws of <i>Tenthredo</i>, so that the vagina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
in which these move may be considered as a <i>double</i>
sheath: only, as these were to be pushed out at the <i>same</i>
time, and the others <i>alternately</i>, it was necessary that in
the latter each sheath should be separate, to admit of this
motion; but as to its composition, the weapon in both is
essentially the same. At any rate this structure could
furnish a reason only for the formation of a separate
group in the <i>same</i> Order, but none for the transfer of
such group to <i>another</i>, which had no such instrument
at all; since, as we have seen, the <i>Trichoptera</i> extrude
their eggs at once in a mass<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>. I do not mean, however,
that it should be inferred from what I have here said,
that there is no <i>tendency</i> in the saw-flies towards a Trichopterous
type, for in them nature seems pointing that
way, but the distance is too great, and the number of
types of form necessary to fill up the interval too many,
to warrant in my opinion their removal from the one
Order to the other.</p>

this Order to those insects which have a <i>promuscis</i>,
which he denominated a <i>rostrum</i><a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>; but afterwards, convinced
that the <i>Orthoptera</i> of the moderns could not be
associated properly with the <i>Coleoptera</i>; instead of forming
them into a distinct Order, as nature would have
dictated&mdash;perhaps to avoid the multiplication of Orders
and without altering his definition&mdash;with equal infelicity
he added them to this. Subsequent Entomologists, who
saw the impropriety of masticating insects thus herding
with suctorious ones, restricted the Order to its old limits;
but Latreille very judiciously altered its arrangement,
and divided it into two Sections, separating those whose
hemelytra terminate in membrane, from those in which
they are mostly tegmina, or of a substance intermediate
between that of the elytra of <i>Coleoptera</i> and that of the
wings of the Tetrapterous Orders. He denominated the
first of these sections, or rather suborders, <i>Heteroptera</i>,
and the last <i>Homoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>. Dr. Leach, observing that
very considerable differences take place both in the economy
and structure of Heteropterous and Homopterous
insects, followed De Geer in considering them as separate
Orders, which he has called <i>Hemiptera</i> and <i>Omoptera</i>,
and in which he has been followed by Mr. MacLeay;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
who, however, with his usual accuracy and judgment,
has restored the aspirate to the latter name<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>. Their
agreement in having a <i>promuscis</i>, or instrument of suction,
with a jointed sheath, at present induces me to hesitate
as to the propriety of their separation, and to consider
them as forming <i>secondary</i> rather than <i>primary</i> sections
of the Class. That you may be enabled to judge
for yourself upon this subject, I will state the principal
features in which they differ. In the first place, the Heteropterous
section usually sucks the juices of <i>animals</i>,
and the Homopterous, those of <i>plants</i>; in the former, the
<i>Hemelytra</i>, besides their different substance, as well as
the wings, cross each other; while in the latter, the organs
of flight are deflexed, and do not lap over each other at
all. The antennæ also of the one are often long, and do
not terminate in a <i>bristle</i>; while in the other, with few
exceptions, they are very short and setigerous. In the
<i>Heteroptera</i> the body is depressed and flat, in the <i>Homoptera</i>
convex and thick. In the former, the scutellum is
one of the principal features of the trunk; in the latter,
not at all remarkable<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a>. Other differences in the structure,
both of head, trunk, and abdomen, might be pointed
out; but these you will chiefly find noticed in my letters
on the External Anatomy of Insects, where I treated of
those parts. I shall here, therefore, only further mention
the ovipositor also as forming a most striking distinction<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a>.

Latr.). MM. Latreille and MacLeay are of opinion
that <i>Semblis</i> F. and <i>Phryganea</i> L. ought to be associated
in the <i>same</i> group; and the latter gentleman has backed
his opinion by some apparently cogent arguments<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>: there
are others, however, that seem to me more cogent, for
considering them as belonging to <i>different</i> Orders. Whoever
examines the several tribes into which Mr. MacLeay
has divided the <i>Neuroptera</i>, will observe in all of
them a distinct <i>prothorax</i>, a circumstance which they
possess in common with those Orders that use their mandibles
for <i>mastication</i>; whereas in those that do <i>not</i> use
them for mastication, as the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, or that take
their food by suction, this part is replaced by a mostly
narrow collar, forming a part of the alitrunk<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a>. The existence
then of the <i>prothorax</i> in the <i>Perlidæ</i>, and of the
<i>collar</i> in the <i>Trichoptera</i>, affords no slight presumptive
evidence that they belong to different Orders. Another
circumstance that weighs much with me is, that the type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
of the neuration of the wings in <i>Perla</i> is taken from the
<i>Neuroptera</i>, in the <i>Trichoptera</i> from the <i>Lepidoptera</i>;
the same observation extends to the legs of both<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>, and
likewise to the abdomen. Even in their oral organs, as
far at least as relates to their mandibles, those of <i>Perla</i>,
though membranaceous&mdash;a circumstance occurring even
in <i>Coleoptera</i>&mdash;are of a Neuropterous type; while the
angular termination of the cheeks in the <i>Phryganeæ</i> approaches
to the Lepidopterous mandibular rudiments.
The principal argument on which Mr. MacLeay's opinion
seems to rest, is, that the larvæ of both are
aquatic, and clothe themselves in cases formed of various
materials: but though this circumstance shows that they
approximate in the system, it does not prove that they
belong to the same order, since the general habit and
appearance of the two animals when arrived at perfection
contravenes it. The larvæ of <i>Myrmeleon</i> and of
<i>Leptis Vermileo</i> form pitfalls of sand for their prey, and
when they become pupæ, cover themselves with it<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>; but
this in them does not even prove an affinity, but only an
analogy. The larva of <i>Perla</i> is carnivorous<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a>, that of
<i>Phryganea</i> mostly herbivorous<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>: so that they are not
precisely similar in their habits. Whether they resemble
each other <i>altogether</i>, in their form, does not clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
appear. The above reasons will, I trust, justify me for
considering them <i>at present</i> as belonging to different
Orders; but if further discoveries should confirm the
opinion Mr. MacLeay espouses, I shall have no hesitation
in yielding to it.</p>

Besides the scales that cover their wings, they
are distinguished by the peculiar instrument of suction
formerly described: neither of these characters, however,
is perfectly universal; some of the Order (<i>Nudaria</i>)
having no scales upon their wings, and others being
without any <i>antlia</i> (<i>Aglossa</i>). Other peculiar characters
are to be found in them; for instance, the <i>patagia</i>, or
tippets, that adorn their evanescent thorax<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a>, and the

appears indebted for its name to the philosopher of

counter-parts&mdash;the <i>Hymenoptera</i>&mdash;by their having an
<i>oral</i>, while these have an <i>anal</i> sting<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a>: and we may add,
that while the last, on account of their wonderful economy
and the benefits which by them <span class="smcap">Providence</span> confers
upon mankind, have been justly regarded as the

we consider the filthy and disgusting habits of their

incessant assaults, of them, in their fly-state, may very
properly be considered as its <i>canaille</i>. Almost all the
tribes of <i>Hymenoptera</i>, from the saw-flies to the ants,
have their representatives in this Order. Though the
number of wings is its prominent feature, yet there are

and the <i>Eproboscidea</i> of Latreille seem rather a kind of

winged and partly apterous, between the two. I have

<i>Suctoria</i> Latr.) This is an osculant Order, and is distinguished
from the other <i>Aptera</i> L. in undergoing a
regular metamorphosis. The larva is vermiform, the
pupa incomplete, and inclosed in a cocoon. Probably
the common flea and the chigoe would form distinct
genera. The number of species of fleas is greater than
has been supposed. I have been informed that Dr. Leach
is acquainted with fourteen British species alone. Besides
their metamorphosis, they are distinguished from
the <i>Aptera</i> by the number of segments into which their
body is divided, and by their pentamerous tarsi. Something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>

<p>We are now come to those insects which, though they
change their skin in their progress to their state of perfection,
and some of them, as we have seen<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>, gain additional
segments and pairs of legs, yet none of them acquire
wings or wing-cases: these I have considered as
forming one Order, under the denomination of</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">Aptera</span><a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> (<i>Synistata</i>, <i>Antliata</i>, <i>Unogata</i>, <i>Mitosata</i>
F.). I do not give this as a <i>natural</i> Order. Our
knowledge, however, of the internal organization of its
groups, is not at present sufficiently matured to warrant
the formation of them into new <i>Classes</i><a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>: till that is more
fully ascertained, it seems to me therefore best to consider
these groups as forming three <i>Suborders</i>: the <i>first</i>
consisting of the <i>Hexapods</i>; the <i>second</i> of the <i>Octopods</i>;
and the <i>third</i> of the <i>Polypods</i>. It will be better, I think,
instead of giving a general character of the Order,&mdash;which
principally consists in the insects composing it
being <i>Apterous</i>, or never acquiring organs of flight,&mdash;to
define each of these groups.</p>


<p><i>Hexapods</i> (<i>Ametabolia</i> Leach, <i>Ametabola</i> M<sup>c</sup>L.). <i>Six</i>
legs may be regarded as the natural number in <i>all</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
insect tribes<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a>: but our business now is with those <i>Aptera</i>
whose body consists of <i>three</i> greater segments, and which
in none of their states have ever more or less than <i>six</i>
legs, and consist of the three Linnean genera <i>Pediculus</i>,
<i>Lepisma</i>, and <i>Podura</i> (<i>Thysanura</i> and <i>Anoplura</i>). Some
of the mites (<i>Acarus</i> L.) are hexapods, but their body
has no distinction of head, trunk, and abdomen. The
metamorphosis of most female <i>Blattæ</i>, and of some other
<i>Orthoptera</i> that are apterous, cannot be regarded as
materially different from that of the Hexapods. Amongst
the <i>Anoplura</i>,&mdash;the <i>Pediculi</i>, or lice, are suctorious, and
the <i>Nirmi</i>, or bird-lice, masticators,&mdash;a circumstance
which in them does not appear to indicate even a different
Order, and proves that undue stress ought not to
be laid, independently of general characters, on the mode
in which insects take their food.</p>

the <i>Acaridea</i>, <i>Sironidea</i>, <i>Phalangidea</i>, and part of the
<i>Scorpionidea</i> of Mr. MacLeay, and, with some exceptions,
of the Linnean genera <i>Acarus</i> and <i>Phalangium</i>.
This last tribe (for with Linné, I include <i>Chelifer</i> and
<i>Obsidium</i> in the <i>Phalangidea</i>,) on one side approaches
<i>Scorpio</i> by <i>Thelyphonus</i>, and on the other the <i>Aranidea</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>

consider the transit from the one to the other as above
stated. The folded abdomen of <i>Gonyleptes</i> seems much
to correspond with that of the <i>cancriform</i> spiders (<i>Carkinodes
cancriformis</i>, &amp;c.).</p>

<p><i>Polypods.</i> This suborder consists of Dr. Leach's
Class <i>Myriapoda</i>, or the <i>Chilognatha</i> and <i>Chilopoda</i> of
Latreille, corresponding with the Linnean genera <i>Iulus</i>
and <i>Scolopendra</i>. Mr. MacLeay has arranged them in
the same Class with the Hexapods, and connects them
with the <i>Anoplura</i> by means of certain intestinal worms
of an indistinct annulose structure<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> (<i>Entozoa Nematoidea</i>
Rud.), in which the sexes are di&#339;cious, and some of
which are furnished with lateral spinulæ,&mdash;thus, as he
supposes, connected with the Polypods; and with the
<i>Anoplura</i> by others (<i>Epizoaria</i> Lam.) in which appendages
appear somewhat analogous to the legs of Hexapods,
as in <i>Cecrops</i> Leach, and which like them are
parasitic animals<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a>. But the right of these worms to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
considered as members of the same Class with the Hexapods

<p>I must next say something on the Orders of the <i>Arachnida</i>.
Every one, at first sight, sees that <i>spiders</i> and
<i>scorpions</i> are separated by characters so strongly marked,
that they look rather like animals belonging to different
Classes than to the same: these form the two <i>primary</i>
Orders of the <i>Arachnida</i>, and they appear to be connected
by two <i>secondary</i> or osculant ones,&mdash;on the one
side by <i>Galeodes</i>, and on the other by <i>Thelyphonus</i> and
<i>Phrynus</i><a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a>. This Class, although there is an appearance
of eight legs, is, strictly speaking, of a <i>Hexapod</i> type; for
the anterior pair, ordinarily regarded as legs and performing
their function, are really the analogues of the
maxillary palpi of perfect insects. This will be evident
to you if you examine any species of <i>Galeodes</i>. These
animals, if we look at them cursorily, we should regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
as <i>Decapods</i>; but when we trace the two anterior pairs of
apparent legs to their insertion, we find that both proceed
from the <i>head</i>, which in that genus is distinct from
the trunk; while the three last pairs, which alone are furnished
with claws, are planted, as legs usually are, in
the latter part. The first pair represent the ordinary palpi
of <i>Arachnida</i>, are analogous to the labial ones of Hexapods,
and, as likewise in <i>Phrynus</i> and <i>Thelyphonus</i>, are
more robust than what are usually taken for the first
pair of legs; but they differ in being considerably longer,
and instead of terminating in a <i>chela</i> are furnished with
a retractile sucker<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>. The second pair are more slender
and shorter than the first; they correspond precisely with
what are deemed the first pair of legs of <i>Octopods</i> and
<i>Arachnida</i>, and are clearly analogous to the maxillary
palpi of perfect insects. Whether the base of the first
pair of these palpi is in any respect analogous to the labium
of insects, (as that of the second seems to be to their
maxillæ,) I am not prepared to assert: it will therefore be
most advisable to name these palpi <i>anterior</i> and <i>posterior</i>:
but as they evidently proceed from the <i>head</i> in
<i>Galeodes</i>, and in that genus are clearly analogous to
those of the <i>Phrynidea</i>, (which in their turn as clearly represent
those of the <i>Aranidea</i>,) it follows that in all they
are organs of the part representing the <i>head</i>, and therefore
not in a <i>primary</i> sense <i>legs</i>; although in a <i>secondary</i>,
as M. Savigny has proved, they may be so called<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a>.

<p>v. Having considered the <i>Orders</i> into which <i>Insecta</i>
and <i>Arachnida</i> may be divided, I am next to give you
some account of the <i>groups</i> into which each is further
resolvable. To draw out, however, a complete scheme
of these would be deviating from my province, and extend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
this letter to an enormous length. Indeed, to give
the <i>natural</i> primary and subordinate sections of every
Order, would require a knowledge of the subject to which
no Entomologist has yet attained. I shall therefore only
say something general upon them, and refer you to an
example of each kind of group.</p>

<p>Previously to the groups themselves their <i>nomenclature</i>
claims our attention. M. Latreille in his last arrangement
of <i>Annulose</i> animals has divided his Orders into
<i>Sections</i>; <i>Families</i>; <i>Tribes</i>; and <i>Genera</i>: his tribes he
has often further subdivided into lesser sections, represented
by capital and small letters, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a>. Mr. MacLeay,
discarding the term section, has <i>Tribes</i>; <i>Races</i> (<i>Stirps</i>);
<i>Families</i>; <i>Genera</i>, and <i>Subgenera</i><a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a>. But as in descending
from the <i>Order</i> to the lowest term, or the <i>species</i>, a series
of groups gradually diminishing in value, which require
a greater number of denominations than have yet been
employed by Entomologists, often occur, I think we may
with benefit to the science add to the list. I would
therefore propose the following primary and subordinate
divisions of an Order: 1. <i>Suborder</i>; 2. <i>Section</i>; 3. <i>Subsection</i>;
4. <i>Tribe</i>; 5. <i>Subtribe</i>; 6. <i>Stirps</i>; 7. <i>Family</i>;
8. <i>Genus</i>; 9. <i>Subgenus</i>. I would further propose that
each of these successive groups should have a name always
terminating alike, so that the value of the group
when spoken of might always be known by the termination:&mdash;thus
if a subclass end in <i>ata</i>, a suborder might
end in <i>ita</i>; a section in <i>ana</i>, a subsection in <i>ena</i>; a tribe
in <i>ina</i>, a subtribe in <i>ona</i>; a stirps in <i>una</i>; and a family
in <i>idæ</i>; the genera being left free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>With regard to their <i>characters</i>, we are not to place
our groups upon Procrustes' bed, and lop or torture
them to accommodate them to every standard we may
have fixed for them: assuming one set of characters for
suborders, another for tribes, and so for every other
group; for the value of characters varies,&mdash;those that in
some cases are common to an <i>Order</i>, in others indicate
only <i>sections</i>, or <i>tribes</i>, or <i>genera</i> and <i>species</i>, or sometimes
even <i>sexes</i>. What is constant in one group is not
so in another, and <i>vice versâ</i>; so that it is a vain labour
to search for a <i>universal</i> character. If it is our wish
really to trace the labyrinth of nature, we can only accomplish
it by a careful perusal and examination of her
various groups. It is singular how much and how far
various Entomologists, and those of the very highest
class, have been misled by a kind of <i>favouritism</i> to give
too universal a currency to certain characters for which
they have conceived a predilection. Some have been
the champions of the <i>antennæ</i>; others of the <i>trophi</i>;
others again of the <i>wings</i>; and others of the <i>metamorphosis</i>.
These are all characters which within certain
limits lead us right, and are an index to a natural group;
but if we follow them further, we leave the system of nature,
and are perplexed in the mazes of a <i>method</i><a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a>.
</p>

<p>Let us now see whether we can pitch upon any suborder
which will afford an example of every group that
we have lately named. Mr. MacLeay, from a consideration
of the larvæ of that Order, has divided the <i>Coleoptera</i>
into five primary groups that may be denominated
<i>Suborders</i>. Whether these are all natural groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
has not yet been made sufficiently evident. It answers
my present purpose, however, to assume it as proved. I
select therefore his <i>Chilopodimorpha</i> for my suborder,
altering the name as above proposed to <i>Chilopodimorph</i>it<i>a</i>:
for my <i>Section</i> I take the Predaceous beetles, or
<i>Adephaga</i> of M. Clairville, distinguished by having the
upper lobe of their maxillæ biarticulate and palpiform;&mdash;these
I would denominate <i>Adephag</i>an<i>a</i>, or devourers.
They consist of two groups forming two subsections, the
one <i>terrestrial</i> and the other <i>aquatic</i>; which I would
name, following Mr. MacLeay, <i>Geodephag</i>en<i>a</i> and <i>Hydrodephag</i>en<i>a</i>.
These two subsections are each resolvable
into two <i>Tribes</i> constituted by Linné's four genera
<i>Cicindela</i> and <i>Carabus</i>; <i>Dytiscus</i> and <i>Gyrinus</i>. The
first tribe, remarkable for the swiftness of their <i>flight</i>, I
would name <i>Eupter</i>in<i>a</i>, or fliers; the second, equally
noted for <i>running</i>, <i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i>, or runners; the third
<i>Eunech</i>in<i>a</i>, or swimmers; and the fourth <i>Gyronech</i>in<i>a</i>,
or swimmers in a circle. The second of these groups,
the <i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i>, are resolvable into two other groups or
<i>Subtribes</i>; one distinguished by having the cubit or anterior
tibia <i>notched</i>, (which, from their being in general
not very brilliant in colour, I would call <i>Amaur</i>on<i>a</i>, or
obscure); the other having the cubit without a notch,
(which, from the brilliancy of many of them, I would
name <i>Lampr</i>on<i>a</i>, or splendid). These subtribes are
both further resolvable into two or more <i>races</i> (<i>Stirpes</i>).
I select that to which the <i>crepitant</i> <i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i> belong,
containing those which from their usually truncated
elytra MM. Latreille and Dejean have named <i>Truncatipennes</i><a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a>:
these, to shorten the name, I call <i>Truncipenn</i>un<i>a</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
This brings us down to the lowest group formed
out of genera and subgenera: or the <i>family</i>, which from
its principal genus is named <i>Brachinidæ</i>, and which
leads us to the <i>genus Brachinus</i>, and the <i>subgenus Aptini</i>.
Thus we get the following scale, expressing every division
of an Order, till we arrive at its lowest term, or
the <i>species</i> that compose it.</p>

<p>In the construction of this scale I have endeavoured
to steer clear of being led by any system, but, with the
exception of the <i>Suborder</i>, which I assume, to resolve it
into natural groups gradually decreasing in value, or
tending to the lowest term, which appear all of them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
have been considered as such by preceding Entomologists.
The four <i>Tribes</i> into which the two subsections
<i>Geodephag</i>en<i>a</i> and <i>Hydradephag</i>en<i>a</i> appear resolvable,
are not only distinguished by the characters of the perfect
insect, but likewise by those of their larvæ, which
are constructed on four distinct types; those of the <i>Gyronech</i>in<i>a</i>
being the most perfectly Chilopodimorphous
of the whole, and those of the <i>Eunech</i>in<i>a</i> the least so<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>.
The former appear rather to form an osculant tribe, or
one without the circle, than one within it; and to be going
off towards another section, including <i>Hydrophilus</i>,
<i>Sphæridium</i>, &amp;c. I must observe, that between <i>Dytiscus</i>
and <i>Hydrophilus</i> there is a striking agreement both in
their form and habits in the larvæ<a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>, and even in several
characters in the perfect insect; so as in many respects
to generate a doubt whether they ought not to
enter the same circle and to follow each other. Yet the
change of habits in the latter, which from a carnivorous
larva becomes a herbivorous beetle; the consequent
change of structure in their oral organs, their antennæ,
and other striking differences; and the evident intervention
of the <i>Gyronech</i>in<i>a</i> and some other osculant tribes between
the two, forbid their union in one and the same circle.</p>

<p>vi. I need not say more on those larger groups of an
Order which conduct us to what are denominated its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
<i>genera</i>; but upon these last it will not be a waste of your
time to enlarge a little. In the last edition of the <i>Systema
Naturæ</i>, and in its appendixes, Linné has described
2840 species of <i>Insecta</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>, which he divided
into 83 genera, allowing upon an average nearly 35
species to each genus. From the paucity of the materials,
therefore, of which his system was constructed,
there was no loud call upon him for numerous genera.
But now more than thirty times that number are said to
have found a place in the cabinets of collectors<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a>, and
there is good reason for thinking that perhaps half that
are in existence are as yet undiscovered;&mdash;this makes
it a matter of absolute necessity to subdivide the Linnean
genera, which in fact, with regard to the majority of
them, were the <i>primary</i> groups of his Orders, rather
than an approximation to the <i>ultimate</i>. But this principle
may be carried too far: for it is the nature of man
to pass from one extreme to the other: and this seems to
me to be the case when it is proposed to make genera the
<i>extreme</i> term of subdivision before you arrive at species.
But it is argued by a very acute Zoologist, that simplicity,
perspicuity, and room for necessary variations are best
preserved by distinguishing these subdivisions each by
an appropriate name<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a>:&mdash;Granted. But still it is only a
choice of evils. It would require probably more than
10,000 names to designate them, were every extreme
group distinguished by a name: but if Mr. MacLeay's
admirable pattern exhibited in his genus <i>Phanæus</i><a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> were
followed, it would not call for more than 2000&mdash;could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
the trifling difficulty occasioned sometimes by the discovery
of a new group, be set against the advantage of having
only 2000 names to commit to memory instead of
10,000<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a>? But if, after all, it is judged best to name subgenera,
M. Savigny's excellent plan of distinguishing
them by a plural termination would diminish the weight
of the above objection, and might be used with advantage.</p>

<p>When the component parts of any minor group differ
from another,&mdash;for the most part in important characters,
indicating some tangible difference in their habits
and economy, and confirmed by peculiarities in their
larvæ; and these differences run through the whole, except
that as usual they grow weaker as it is passing off
to another; especially where they are striking in the
centre or type of the group,&mdash;this is always a legitimate
genus: but where the characters assumed are very slight,
and nothing peculiar in its habits, economy or larva,
warrant such distinction, it ought not to be conferred.</p>


<p>vii. I must next say a word concerning species and
varieties. A <i>species</i> is a natural object whose differences
from those most nearly related to it had their origin
when it came from the hands of its <span class="smcap">Creator</span>; while
those that characterize a <i>variety</i>, have been produced
since that event. As we do not know the value and
weight of the momenta by which climate, food, and other
supposed fortuitous circumstances operate upon animal
forms, we cannot point out any certain diagnostic by
which in all cases a species may be distinguished from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
a variety;&mdash;for those characters that in some are constant,
in others vary. In general, where there is no difference
in <i>form</i>, <i>appendages</i> and <i>organs</i>, <i>sculpture</i>, <i>proportions</i>
and <i>larvæ</i>,&mdash;<i>colour</i> alone, especially in insects inhabiting
the same district, only indicates a casual variety.
Thus <i>Aphodius luridus</i> has sometimes pale elytra with the
striæ black (<i>Scarabæus nigro-sulcatus</i> Marsh.): at others it
has black spots between the striæ, as in the type: in a
third variety the elytra are black at the base and pale at
the apex (<i>Sc. varius</i> Marsh.); and lastly, in a fourth they
are intirely black (<i>Sc. gagates</i> Marsh.);&mdash;yet all these in
every other respect precisely correspond. But the converse
of this will scarcely hold good; for doubtless minor
differences of structure are sometimes produced by a
different food and climate: which may probably account
for some variations observable in the individuals apparently
of the same species obtained from different countries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having considered the kind and value of the groups
into which <i>Annulose</i> animals, and more especially insects,
may be divided, I shall next call your attention to their
<i>composition</i>. There are <i>five</i> numbers and their multiples
which seem more particularly to prevail in nature:
namely, <i>Two</i>&mdash;<i>Three</i>&mdash;<i>Four</i>&mdash;<i>Five</i> and <i>Seven</i>. But
though these numbers are <i>prevalent</i>, no one of them can
be deemed <i>universal</i>. The <i>binary</i> number, which affords
the most simple, and for that reason perhaps not
the least valuable, mode of arrangement, we see exemplified
when two branches, so to speak, diverge from a
common stem,&mdash;as in the <i>Vegetable</i> and <i>Animal</i> kingdoms;
the <i>terrestrial</i> and <i>aquatic</i> Predaceous beetles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
in the <i>thalerophagous</i> and <i>saprophagous Lamellicorn</i> ones;
in the <i>Anoplura</i> and <i>Thysanura</i>; the <i>Chilopoda</i> and
<i>Chilognatha</i> amongst <i>Apterous</i> insects; in the <i>Scorpionidea</i>
and <i>Aranidea</i> amongst the <i>Arachnida</i>; and in the
<i>Macrura</i> and <i>Brachyura</i> amongst the Decapod <i>Crustacea</i>.
Again, in other cases <i>three</i> seems to be the most
prominent number: this takes place sometimes with regard
to the <i>primary</i> groups of an Order, or what I denominate
the <i>Suborders</i>. Thus we have the <i>Diurnal</i>,
<i>Crepuscular</i>, and <i>Nocturnal Lepidoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a>; the Linnean
genera <i>Blatta</i>, <i>Mantis</i>, and <i>Gryllus</i> constitute the <i>Orthoptera</i>;
and other instances of this number might be
produced in some minor groups. But that which appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
to prevail most widely in nature is what may be
called the <i>quaterno-quinary</i>; according to which, groups
consist of four minor ones; one of which is excessively
capacious in comparison of the other three, and is always
divisible into two; which gives <i>five</i> of the same
degree, but of which, two have a greater affinity to each
other than they have to the other three<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a>. Mr. W. S.
MacLeay, in the progress of his inquiries to ascertain
the station of <i>Scarabæus sacer</i>, discovered that the thalerophagous
and saprophagous Petalocerous beetles resolved
themselves each into a circle containing <i>five</i> such
groups. And having got this principle, and finding that
this number and its multiples prevailed much in nature,
he next applied it to the Animal Kingdom in general:
and from the result of this investigation, it appeared to
him that it was nearly, if not altogether, universal<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>.
Nearly at the same time a discovery almost parallel was
made and recorded by three eminent Botanists, MM.
Decandolle, Agardh, and Fries, with regard to some
groups of the Vegetable Kingdom<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a>; and more recently
Mr. Vigors thinks he has discovered the same quinary
arrangement in various groups of birds<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a>. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
a most remarkable coincidence, and seems a strong argument
in favour of Mr. MacLeay's system. I should
observe, however, that according to that system, as
stated in his <i>Horæ Entomologicæ</i>, if the osculant or
transition groups are included, the total number is <i>seven</i><a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a>:&mdash;these
are groups small in number both of genera and
species, that intervene between and connect the larger
ones. Each of these osculant groups may be regarded
as divided into <i>two</i> parts, the one belonging to the <i>upper</i>
circle and the other to the <i>lower</i>; so that each circle or
larger group is resolvable into five <i>interior</i> and two <i>exterior</i>
ones, thus making up the number <i>seven</i>. Though
Mr. MacLeay regards this quinary arrangement of natural
objects as very general, it does not appear that he
looks upon it as absolutely universal,&mdash;since he states
organized matter to begin in a dichotomy<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a>: and he does
not resolve its ultimate groups into five species; nor am
I certain that he regards the penultimate groups as invariably
consisting of five ultimate ones. In <i>Copris</i> I
seem in my own cabinet to possess ten or twelve distinct
types<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a>; and in <i>Phanæus</i>, the fifth type, which Mr. MacLeay
regards as containing insects resembling all the
other types<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a>, appears to me rather divided into <i>two</i>;
one formed by <i>P. carnifex</i>, <i>Vindex</i>, <i>igneus</i>, &amp;c., and
the other by <i>P. splendidulus</i>, <i>floriger</i>, <i>Kirbii</i>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>The great point which demands our attention in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
considering a numerical arrangement of the Kingdoms of
Nature is the <i>value</i> of the component members of each
group. It is by no means difficult to divide a <i>Kingdom</i>,
a <i>Class</i>, or an <i>Order</i> into two, or three, or five, or seven
or more groups, according to any system we may be inclined
to favour; but it is not so easy to do this so that
the groups shall be of equal rank. Yet it seems requisite
that in grouping our objects, as we descend towards
the lowest term we should resolve each only into
its primary elements, and of them form the next group;
and so on till we come to species. When I say of <i>equal
rank</i>, I do not mean an exact parity between the members
into which a group is primarily resolvable,&mdash;because
there will always be a degradation <i>in descensu</i> from the
perfection of the type; but merely that parity (to use a
metaphor) that there is between children of the same
mother, differing in their relative ages and approach to
the perfection of their nature. Perhaps it may be observed
with respect to the quinary system, that this condition
is not complied with, since two of the groups taken
<i>per se</i> appear really to form one group; or to be much
nearer to each other than to the remaining groups. But
when it is taken into consideration that this great group,
always resolvable into two, is the typical group, and that
the two are really equal, or rather superior in value to
the three others, the objection seems to vanish.</p>

<p>With regard to all numerical systems we may observe,
that since variation is certainly one of the most universal
laws of nature, we may conclude that different numbers
prevail in different departments, and that all the numbers
above stated as prevalent are often resolvable or
reducible into each other. So that where Physiologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
appear to differ, or think they differ, they frequently
really agree.</p>

<p>II. The <span class="smcap">Almighty Creator</span>, when he clothed the
world that he had made with <i>plants</i>, and peopled it with
<i>animals</i>, besides the manifestation of his own glory,
appears to have had <i>two</i> most important purposes in
view;&mdash;the one to provide a supply for the mutual wants
of the various living objects he had created, for the
continuance of the species, and for the maintenance of
a due proportion, as to numbers, of each kind, so that
all might subserve to the good of the whole; and the
other, that by them he might <i>instruct</i> his creature man
in such civil, physical, moral and spiritual truths, as were
calculated to fit him for his station in the visible world,
and gradually prepare him to become an inhabitant of
that invisible one for which he was destined. The first
of these purposes was best promoted by creating things
"according to their kind," with sexes mon&#339;cious or
di&#339;cious; that groups of beings related to each other,
and agreeing in their general structure, might discharge
a common function. This we see to be the case generally
in nature; for where there is an affinity in the <i>structure</i>,
there is usually an affinity in the <i>function</i>. The
last,&mdash;or the instruction of man in his primeval state of
integrity and purity,&mdash;was best secured by placing before
him for his scrutiny a book of emblems or symbols, in
which one thing either by its form or qualities, or both,
might represent another. If he was informed by his
Creator that the works of creation constituted such a
book, by the right interpretation of which he might arrive
at spiritual verities as well as natural knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
curiosity and the desire of information concerning these
high and important subjects would stimulate him to the
study of the mystic volume placed before him; in the
progress of which he would doubtless be assisted by that
<span class="smcap">Divine</span> guidance, which even now is with those who
honestly seek the truth. Both divines and philosophers
have embraced this opinion, which is built upon the
word of <span class="smcap">God</span> itself<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a>.
</p>

<p>This last purpose of the Creator was the root of the
analogies, connecting different objects with each other
that have no real affinity, observable in the works of
creation: so that from the bottom to the top of the scale
of being, there is many a series of analogous forms, as
well as of concatenated ones; and the intire system of
nature is <i>representative</i>, as well as operative: it is a kind
of <i>Janus bifrons</i>, which requires to be studied in two aspects
looking different ways. To what degree of knowledge
the primeval races of men attained after the fall,
by the contemplation and study of this book of nature,
we are no where informed; but we learn from the highest
authority that the revelation that <span class="smcap">God</span> thus made of
himself was in time corrupted, by those that <i>professing</i>
themselves to be <i>wise</i> became <i>fools</i>, to the grossest idolatry,
which sunk men in the lowest depths of sensuality,
vice, and wickedness<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a>.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>In no country was this effect more lamentably striking
than in Egypt, whose gods were all selected from the
animal and vegetable kingdoms.</p>

<p>This species of idolatry doubtless originally resulted
from their having been taught that things <i>in</i> nature were
symbols of things <i>above</i> nature, and of the attributes and
glory of the Godhead. In process of time, while the
corruption <i>remained</i>, the knowledge which had been
thus abused was <i>lost</i> or dimly seen. The Egyptian
priesthood perhaps retained some remains of it; but by
them it was made an esoteric doctrine, not to be communicated
to the profane vulgar, who were suffered to
regard the various objects of their superstitious veneration,
not as <i>symbols</i>, but as possessed of an <i>inherent</i>
divinity: and probably the mysteries of Isis in Egypt,
and of Ceres at Eleusis, were instituted, that this esoteric
doctrine, which was to be kept secret and sacred from
the common people, might not be lost.</p>

<p>But this kind of analogy is of a higher order than that
of which I am here principally to speak,&mdash;that, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
which the various objects of nature bear to each other.
This, however, though of a lower rank, is essentially
connected with the other, and leads to it; for it establishes
the principle, that created things are representative
or symbolical: and we find, when we view them in
this light, that as we ascend from the lowest beings in
the scale of creation, we are led from one to another till
we reach the summit or centre of the whole, and are
thus conducted to the boundaries of this visible and material
system; from whence we may conclude that we
ought not here to stop, but go on to something invisible
and extra-mundane, as the ultimate object intended to be
reflected from this great speculum of creation&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>
himself, and all those spirits, virtues, and powers
that have emanated from him.</p>

<p>The <i>analogies</i> which the various objects of the animal
kingdom mutually exhibit, have for the most part
been either overlooked by modern Physiologists, or have
been mistaken for characters that indicate <i>affinity</i>; a circumstance
that has often perplexed or disrupted their
systems. Dr. Virey appears to have been one of the
first who obtained a general idea of the parallelism of
animals in this respect<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>; and M. Savigny has contrasted
the <i>Mandibulata</i> and <i>Haustellata</i> of the insect tribes as
presenting analogies to each other<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>. But a countryman
of our own (often mentioned with honour in the course
of our correspondence), peculiarly gifted by nature, and
qualified by education and his line of study for such
speculations, and possessing moreover the invaluable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
opportunity of consulting at his ease one of the first Entomological
cabinets in Europe, in a work that will for
ever couple his name with the science that he cultivates<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a>,&mdash;has
first taught the Naturalist the respective value and
real distinctions of the two kinds of relationship that I
am now discussing. He has opened to the philosopher,
the moralist and the divine, that hitherto closed door by
which our first parents and their immediate descendants
entered the temple of nature, and studied the symbols of
knowledge that were there presented to them: and in
addition to his labours (in numerous respects successful),
in endeavouring to trace out the natural groups of beings
connected by <i>affinity</i>, has pointed out how they illustrate
each other by <i>analogy</i>; thus affording, as was before observed<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>,
a most triumphant reply to the arguments of
those modern sophists, who, from the graduated scale of
affinities observable in creation, were endeavouring to
prove that animals, in the lapse of ages, were in fact their
own creators<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a>.
</p>

<p>For the more satisfactory elucidation of the subject
before us, I shall consider, first, how we are to distinguish
affinities from analogies; and then mention some of the
various instances of the latter that occur between insects
and other animals, and between different tribes of insects
themselves.</p>

<p>To know what characters denote affinity and what
are merely analogical, it must be kept in mind that the
former being predicated of beings in a <i>series</i> (whether
that series has its gyrations that return into themselves,
or proceeds in a right line, or assumes any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
intermediate direction, it matters not), it cannot be satisfactorily
ascertained but by considering attentively the gradual
approximation or recession of the structure to or
from a certain type in any point of such series. If, therefore,
you wish to ascertain whether the characters, in
which any given object resembles other objects in certain
groups, indicate affinity or only analogy, you must first
make yourself acquainted with the common features which
distinguish the animals known to belong to that group,&mdash;either
those relating to their structure, or to their
habits and economy. If the object under your eye partakes
in these characters more or less, in proportion as
it approaches the type or recedes from it, the relation it
exhibits is that of <i>affinity</i>; but if, though it resembles
some members of it in several points of its structure, it
differs from the whole group in the general features and
characteristic marks that distinguish it, the relation it
bears to those members is merely that of <i>analogy</i>. Thus,
for instance, <i>Ascalaphus italicus</i> in its antennæ, the colouring
of its wings, and its general aspect, exhibits a
striking resemblance to a <i>butterfly</i>; yet a closer examination
of its characters will satisfy any one that it is in quite
a different series, and has no <i>affinity</i> whatever to that
genus. A departure, however, in only one respect from
what may be called the <i>normal</i> characters of its group,
does not annul the claim of any tribe of insects to remain
in it; since this very often only indicates a retrocession
from the type, and not a disruption of its ties of affinity.
Thus the saw-flies (<i>Serrifera</i>) differ from the other <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
though not in their pupæ, yet more or less
in their larvæ; but this alone cannot countervail their
agreement with that Order in their organs of manducation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
and motion, in their ovipositor, and in the other
details of their structure<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a>.
</p>

<p>I have on a former occasion pointed out many of the
analogies which take place between insects and other
parts of the animal kingdom, and even between insects
and the mineral and vegetable kingdoms<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a>: I shall now
resume the subject more at large, but without recurring
to those last mentioned. In considering the analogies
which connect insects with other animals, or which they
exhibit with respect to each other, we may have recourse
to <i>two</i> methods. We may either consider them as placed
somewhere between the two extremes of a convolving
series, from which station we may trace these analogies
<i>upwards</i> and <i>downwards</i> towards each limit; or we may
conceive them and other animals in this respect arranged
in a number of series that are <i>parallel</i> to each other, in
which the opposite points are analogous. The first mode
will perhaps best explain the analogies that exist between
insects and other animals, and the last those between different
groups of insects themselves. I shall give an example
or two of each method, beginning with the first.</p>

<p>There are two tribes in the animal kingdom that seem
placed in contrast to each other, both by their habits and
by their structure. One of these is carnivorous, living
by rapine and bloodshed, and can seldom be rendered
subservient to our domestic purposes; while the other is
herbivorous or granivorous, is quiet in its habits, and
easily domesticated. Amongst insects we find the representatives
of both: those of the first tribe are distinguished
by their predaceous habits, by the open attacks,
or by the various snares and artifices which they employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
to entrap and destroy other insects. They may usually be
known by their powerful jaws or instruments of suction;
by their prominent or ferocious eyes; by the swiftness
of their motions, either on the earth, in the air, or in the
water; by their fraud and artifice in lying in wait for
their prey. Amongst the <i>Coleoptera</i>, the Predaceous
beetles,&mdash;including the Linnean genera <i>Cicindela</i>, <i>Carabus</i><a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>,
<i>Dytiscus</i>, and <i>Gyrinus</i>,&mdash;are of this description;
and they symbolize those higher animals that by open
violence attack and devour their prey:&mdash;for instance, the
sharks, pikes, &amp;c., amongst the fishes; the eagles, hawks,
&amp;c., amongst the birds; and the whole feline genus
amongst the beasts. Similar characters give a similar
relation of analogy to the <i>Mantidæ</i> and <i>Libellulina</i>
amongst the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Neuroptera</i>. The whole
family of <i>Arachne</i>, the larvæ of the <i>Myrmeleonina</i>, &amp;c.,
portray those animals that to ferocity add cunning and
stratagem, or suck the blood of their victims. The <i>Myriapods</i>
symbolize in a striking manner the Ophidian
reptiles. Look at an <i>Iulus</i>, and both in its motions and
form you will acknowledge that it represents a <i>living</i> serpent;
next turn your eyes to a centipede or <i>Scolopendra</i>,
and you will find it nearly an exact model of the skeleton
of a <i>dead</i> one, the flat segments of its body resembling
the vertebræ, its curving legs the ribs, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
venomous maxillæ the poison-fangs. The great body of
the <i>Orthoptera</i>, the <i>Homopterous Hemiptera</i>, the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
and <i>Trichoptera</i>, afford no example of Predaceous
insects. All the analogies I have here particularized,
ascending from the insect, terminate in races of a corresponding
character and aspect amongst the <i>Mammalia</i>,
and thus lead us towards <i>man</i> himself, or rather to men
in whose minds those bad and malignant qualities prevail,
which, when accompanied by power, harass and lay waste
mankind; and thus ascending from symbol to symbol, we
arrive at an animal who in his own person unites both
matter and spirit, and is thus the member both of a visible
and invisible world: and we are further instructed
by these symbols,&mdash;perpetually recurring under different
forms,&mdash;in the existence of evil and malignant spirits,
whose object and delight is the corporeal and spiritual
ruin of the noble creature who is placed at the head of
the visible works of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>The other tribe of animals that I mentioned of a milder
character, may be looked upon as represented by many
herbivorous, or not carnivorous, insects; amongst others,
the Lamellicorn beetles imitate them by their remarkable
horns, so that they wear the aspect of miniature bulls, or
deer, or antelopes<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a>, or rams, or goats, whether these
horns are processes of the head or of the upper jaws.
The gregarious <i>Hymenoptera</i>, some of which form part of
our domestic treasures, may be regarded in some degree
as belonging to this department. From insects the
ascent upwards, with regard to <i>form</i>, is by some of the
branchiostegous fishes, which symbolize the horns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
cattle; with regard to <i>character</i>, by the various species
of <i>Cyprinus</i> and other similar genera.&mdash;Whether any of
the <i>reptiles</i> may be looked upon as falling into this division,
I am not sufficiently conversant with them to assert;
but if any, the <i>Chelonians</i>, or tortoise and turtle
tribes, are entitled to that distinction. Amongst the birds,
the <i>Gallinæ</i> and <i>Anseres</i>,&mdash;from which Orders we derive
our domestic poultry, whether terrestrial or aquatic,&mdash;and
our game, form the step next below the ruminants, or
cattle: and we are thus again led towards man, and are
symbolically instructed in those domestic and social qualities
which endear us to each other, best promote the
general welfare, and render us most like good spirits and
the Divinity himself; of whom the perpetual recurrence
of animals exhibiting these amiable and useful qualities
is calculated to impress upon us some notion. I might
mention many more instances of ascending analogies; as
from some of the <i>Diptera</i> by the parrots, to the <i>Quadrumanes</i>
or monkey tribes&mdash;or from some of the <i>Iulidæ</i> that
roll themselves into a ball, to the <i>Armadillo</i>; but these
are sufficient to set your mind at work upon the subject,
so that you may trace them for yourself. Nor shall I
occupy your time by pointing out how analogies may be
traced from insects downwards towards the lowest term
in the scale of animal life, but proceed to consider the
analogies observable between insects themselves; in
which I shall follow the <i>second</i> method lately mentioned,
and consider them as arranged in parallel series.</p>

<p>In studying the analogies that take place between insects
themselves, we should always bear in mind that our
inquiry is not concerning an <i>affinity</i> which demands a
correspondence in various particulars that are not necessary
to constitute an analogy; as, for instance, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
should be a mutual imitation in all the states of any two
insects. Wherever we discover a marked resemblance
between two <i>perfect</i> insects, there is a true analogy,
though their metamorphosis may differ; and where there
is <i>not</i> that resemblance, though the metamorphosis may
agree, there is no analogy. In fact, insects are sometimes
analogous in their <i>first</i> state and <i>not</i> in their <i>last</i>;
and at other times analogous in their <i>last</i> and <i>not</i> in their
<i>first</i>; but the analogy is most perfect when it holds in
<i>all</i> their states: it then, indeed, almost approaches to an
affinity. They may also be analogous to each other in
their <i>habits</i> and <i>economy</i>, when there is little or no resemblance
in their <i>form</i>; and, <i>vice versa</i>, be analogous in
their <i>form</i> and not in their <i>habits</i>. So that different sets
of analogies may be assumed as foundations for different
systems. Thus Mr. MacLeay assumes the <i>metamorphosis</i>
as the basis of analogy between the corresponding
Orders of <i>Mandibulata</i> and <i>Haustellata</i><a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>, while M. Savigny
compares the <i>perfect</i> insects<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a>: the result therefore
differs in some instances. I shall now lay before you
in a tabular view their plans and my own.

<p>In these two last columns, you see, I differ little from
M. Savigny: I merely exclude the <i>Aphaniptera</i> as
forming an osculant Order, and I have added the <i>Coleoptera</i>
and Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i> for reasons I shall
soon assign. From Mr. MacLeay I differ more widely,
which has resulted from our different ideas as to the
mode of tracing analogies; his theory leading him to the
<i>metamorphosis</i>, and mine leading me<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> to the <i>perfect</i> insect,
for the foundation of our several systems. It remains that
I show how each of the pairs in my columns represent
each other: but I must observe, that the analogies exhibited
by insects in the corresponding Orders of these
columns are not equally striking in all their respective
members; but only in certain individual species or genera,
more or less numerous, by which the nearest approach
is made to the contrasted forms.</p>

<p>To begin with the <i>Coleoptera</i> and Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>.&mdash;Both
are distinguished by having an ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
<i>prothorax</i>, a conspicuous <i>scutellum</i>, the neuration of their
wings, the substance of the hard part of their <i>hemelytra</i>,
which, as in <i>Coleoptera</i>, sometimes imitates horn
and sometimes leather, and is occasionally, like elytra,
lined with a <i>hypoderma</i><a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a>; the articulation of the head
with the trunk is likewise the same in both<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>: and some
Heteropterous species so strikingly resemble beetles
(<i>Lygæus</i>, <i>brevipennis</i> &amp;c.), having little or no membrane
at the end of their hemelytra, that they might
easily be mistaken for them. These circumstances prove,
I think, that this suborder is more analogous to the
<i>Coleoptera</i> than to the <i>Orthoptera</i>, with which it agrees
in scarcely any respect but its metamorphosis. The
counterparts of this last Order indeed, instead of the
<i>Heteropterous</i>, are to be sought for amongst the <i>Homopterous
Hemiptera</i>, various species of which exhibit a
most marked and multifarious analogy with numerous
<i>Orthoptera</i>. Many of both Orders (<i>Cicada</i>, <i>Locusta</i>), as
you have heard long since, are signalized by possessing
the same powers of song, and produced by an analogous
organ<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a>: a large proportion also of both are endued
with wonderful saltatorious powers, and their posterior
tibiæ are similarly armed; their legs in general likewise
are longitudinally angular, and the head in both articulates
with the trunk in the same manner<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a>. In both
Orders too, the upper organs of flight are most commonly
<i>tegmina</i>, but sometimes in both they are nearly
membranous, like <i>wings</i>. In <i>Centrotus</i> and <i>Acrydium</i>,
the one <i>Homopterous</i> and the other <i>Orthopterous</i>, the
front is bilobed, the eyes are small; there are only two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
stemmata between the eyes; the prothorax is conspicuous,
and behind is producted into a long scutelliform
process, under which all the parts also are analogous;
the abdomen articulates with the trunk in the same way,
is similar in shape in both, and consists of short inosculating
segments. Some <i>Fulgoridæ</i> and <i>Truxalides</i> agree
also in their producted front. Other analogous characters
might be named between these tribes, but these are
sufficient to confirm M. Savigny's opinion. That the
<i>Neuroptera</i> present analogies to the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, though
they differ so widely from them in their metamorphosis
and habits, is evident from the instance lately adduced
of <i>Ascalaphus italicus</i>, which was described as a butterfly
by Scopoli<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>; and many of the <i>Libellulina</i>, by their wings,
partly transparent and partly opaque, and by the shape
of those organs and of their bodies, imitate the Heliconian
butterflies: and this resemblance is much more
striking than any that occurs between the perfect insects
in the <i>Neuroptera</i> and Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>. With
regard to the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i> the analogy is
undisputed, and must strike every beholder; and one
would almost say it was a real affinity, were it not that
the resemblance is not only general between Order and
Order, but that almost every Hymenopterous tribe has
its counterpart amongst the <i>Diptera</i>; the saw-flies<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a>
for instance, the ichneumons, the various false-wasps<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a>,
the false-bees<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a>, the bees, the humble-bees, the ants,
&amp;c., severally find there a representative that wears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
its livery and general aspect: a circumstance which
evidently proves that it was part of the plan of the
<span class="smcap">Creator</span> to place them in contrast with each other. Were
I to pursue this subject further, it might not be difficult
to show that were the <i>tribes</i> of <i>Mandibulata</i> or of <i>Haustellata</i>
also arranged in columns, analogies would be discoverable
between their corresponding points: this seems
to be Mr. MacLeay's opinion<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a>; and it is worth your
pursuing the subject further, which cannot but prove
very interesting.</p>

<p>But though the general analogy of these columns is
that of Order to Order, yet individual species in each
Order sometimes find their representatives in a different
one from that with which they generally are contrasted;&mdash;thus
some <i>Diptera</i>, as <i>Culex</i>, by the scales on the veins
and other parts of their wings, are analogous to <i>Lepidoptera</i>
rather than <i>Hymenoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a>; as is also the genus
<i>Psychoda</i> by its form.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We come now to the consideration of a question not
easy to be decided,&mdash;I mean, which Order of insects is
to have the <i>precedency</i>, and which is the connecting link
that unites them to Vertebrate animals.</p>

<p>Linné (and Mr. MacLeay seems in this to coincide
with him) considered the <i>Coleoptera</i> as at the head of the
Class of insects; De Geer thought the <i>Lepidoptera</i> entitled
to that honour; Latreille and Cuvier begin with
the <i>Aptera</i>: Marcel de Serres favours the <i>Orthoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a>;
and others, on account of their admirable economy, have
made the <i>Hymenoptera</i> the princes of the insect world<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
If the claim to priority was to be decided by the exquisiteness
of instincts and the benefits conferred upon the
human race, doubtless it would be in favour of the last-mentioned
insects. If the power to do mischief carried
it, and to lay waste the earth, the <i>Orthoptera</i> would be
entitled as much as any to the bad pre-eminence. If
beauty, and grace, and gaiety, and splendour of colours
were the great requisite, and the law enjoined, <i>Detur
pulchriori</i>,&mdash;the <i>Lepidoptera</i> would doubtless win the
throne. But if perfection and solidity of structure, as
they ought, are to regulate this point; we must, I think,
with the illustrious Swede, assign the palm to the <i>Coleoptera</i>.
If we consider these in all their parts, the
organs for flight only excepted, they seem more perfectly
formed and finished than the insects of any other order.
But which of the Coleopterous tribes are entitled to the
precedency? Linné placed the Lamellicorn beetles at
the head of the order, beginning with the <i>Dynastidæ</i>,
probably led by some characters which seem to connect
these with the Branchiostegous fishes. In this he was
followed by Fabricius. But Latreille and most modern
Entomologists have begun with <i>Cicindela</i> and the other
Predaceous beetles. I am not certain what are Mr. MacLeay's
sentiments on this subject; but from what he says
in the <i>Annulosa Javanica</i><a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>, it does not appear that he is
a convert to the latter opinion. Bulk and strength seem
the most striking characteristics of the former tribe,
which represent the cattle or ruminants amongst Vertebrate
animals.&mdash;Strength united with agility and a considerable
portion of grace and symmetry evidently confers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
a degree of pre-eminence upon the latter, symbolizing
the feline race, which seems to throw no small weight
into their scale.</p>

<p>There are two Classes of Vertebrate animals with
which insects may appear to claim kindred. The <i>fishes</i>,
and the <i>reptiles</i>. <i>Fishes</i> in their fins exhibit no small
resemblance to insects; the pectoral and ventral ones
representing their arms and legs, and the dorsal ones
their wings: <i>Pegasus Draco</i> in this last respect is not
unlike a butterfly<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>. In some genera (<i>Ostracion</i>, <i>Pegasus</i>,
&amp;c.), like insects the animal is covered with a hard
shell or crust, formed by the union of its scales. The
oral <i>cirrhi</i> of many fishes seem analogous to the <i>palpi</i>
of insects; and in some a pair longer than the rest represent
their <i>antennæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a>. Another circumstance in which
insects and fishes correspond, is the wonderful variety of
forms, often in the greatest degree eccentric, that occurs
in both Classes. Some of the cyclostomous fishes, as
<i>Ammoc&#339;tus</i>, <i>Gastrobranchus</i>, are supposed to connect the
fishes with the <i>Annulosa</i>, by means of the <i>Annelida</i> as
an osculant Class<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a>, which Mr. MacLeay regards as the
passage to the <i>Chilopoda</i><a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>: his <i>Mandibulata</i> he considers
as passing into the <i>Anoplura</i> by means of some
osculant Order as yet unknown<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a>. But I must confess
I can see no good ground for this last transition:&mdash;the
<i>Anoplura</i> appear much more nearly related to the <i>Psocidæ</i>,
especially by the apterous <i>Atropos pulsatoria</i><a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> than to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
<i>Coleopterous</i> insect. But having stated these opinions,
I shall leave you to draw your own conclusions, as the
question is still perplexed with many difficulties. I am
ready to admit that some Vertebrates approach near to
the <i>Annelida</i>; but that it is through them alone that
they are connected with insects, is not at present clear.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>reptiles</i>, they seem to be connected
with insects by several characters. In the <i>Chelonians</i>,
the skeleton merges in the external carapace or
shell; the <i>Ophidians</i> change their skin like larvæ;
the <i>Batrachians</i> undergo metamorphoses; some of the
<i>Saurians</i> also have their changes: and the <i>Draco volans</i>
has wings somewhat analogous to those of insects<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>.
Were I to be asked what Order of insects could connect
with reptiles, I should point to the <i>Orthoptera</i>, especially
<i>Gryllus</i> L., which by their noise and saltatorious
powers not a little resemble frogs; and the larvæ
of some strikingly imitate their form<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a>: and of others
even that of a lizard<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a>. But these resemblances, after all,
may only indicate analogies.</p>

<h3><i>HISTORY OF ENTOMOLOGY.</i></h3>


<p>After the very general idea that I have attempted to
embody for you of the <i>System of Insects</i>; of the groups
in which nature has arranged them, and their mutual
relations; it will not be out of place, if I next state to
you what has been effected by Entomologists towards
reducing them to order: or, in other words, if I give you
some account of the various <i>Methods</i> and <i>Systems</i><a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a>, beginning
with the earliest, that have appeared and had
their day, which will include a <i>history</i> of the progress of
our science from its commencement to its present era.</p>

<p>In writing the history of any science, two modes present
themselves. We may either give a chronological review
of all the circumstances and publications connected
with it; or content ourselves with a rapid survey, dwelling
only on the principal epochs, and those lights of the
science who by their immortal labours gave birth to
them. The <i>latter</i> is that on every account best suited
to our present purpose, which I shall therefore here
adopt.</p>

<p>There seem to me to be <i>seven</i> principal epochs into
which the History of Entomology may be divided: viz.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
1. The Era of the <i>Ancients</i>. 2. The Era of the <i>revival</i>
of the science after the darkness of the middle ages.
3. The Era of Swammerdam and Ray, or of the <i>Metamorphotic
System</i>. 4. The Era of Linné, or of the <i>Alary
System</i>. 5. The Era of Fabricius, or of the <i>Maxillary
System</i>. 6. The Era of Latreille, or of the <i>Eclectic
System</i>. And 7. The Era of MacLeay, or of the <i>Quinary
System</i>. All of these appear to form important points,
or resting-places, in the progress of the science towards
its acme; and of each of these I shall now proceed to
give you a brief account.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Era of the Ancients.</i> To ascertain what attention
was paid to insects in the earliest ages, we must
have recourse to the most ancient of records, the Old
Testament. In this sacred volume we are informed that
after the Creation <span class="smcap">God</span> brought the creatures to Adam
that he might name them<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a>. Now the first man, in his
unimpaired state of corporeal, mental, and spiritual
soundness, under the divine guidance, doubtless imposed
upon them names significant of their qualities or structure;
which according to Plato was a work above human
wisdom, and on account of which the ancient Hebrews
deduced that Adam was a philosopher of the highest
endowments<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>. Whether on this great and interesting
occasion he gave names to individual species, or only to
natural groups, does not clearly appear. But probably
as they were created, so were they brought before him
"According to their kinds<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>."
</p>

<p>Subsequently Moses will be thought to have possessed
no ordinary knowledge of insects, if we suppose, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
ingenious remarks of Professor Lichtenstein<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> render
probable, that he distinguishes as clean insects the Fabrician
genera <i>Gryllus</i>, <i>Locusta</i>, <i>Truxalis</i>, and <i>Acheta</i>, which
a person unobservant of these animals would have confounded
together. This discrimination presupposes this
knowledge of their general characters, not only in the
Jewish lawgiver, but also in the people themselves to
whom the precept was addressed, to whom it would
otherwise have been <i>de ignotis</i>.</p>

<p>Allusion is made in Holy Writ to insects of almost
every one of the modern Orders<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a>. They are represented
as employed <i>divinitùs</i> sometimes to annoy the enemies
of the Israelites, and at others to punish that people
themselves when they apostatized from their God. The
prophets frequently introduce them as symbols of enemies
that lay waste or oppress the church: as the <i>fly</i> of
the Ethiopians or Egyptians; the <i>bee</i> of the Assyrians;
and the <i>locust</i> of the followers of Mahomet and other
similar destroyers<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a>. That Solomon, amongst other objects
to the investigation of which his divinely inspired
wisdom directed him, did not deem insects, those "Little
things upon the earth<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a>," unworthy of his attention, we
know from Scripture<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a>; but as his physical writings are
lost, we are ignorant whether he treated of their natural
arrangement, their economy and history, or of the instruction
they afford <i>analogically</i> considered. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
he has referred to them incidentally, it is generally with
this latter view.</p>

<p>If we turn from the word and people of <span class="smcap">God</span> to the
<i>Lovers of Wisdom</i> (as they modestly styled themselves) of
the heathen world, and their writings; we shall discern
amongst them a great light shining, the beams of which
illuminate even our own times. In the illustrious Stagyrite
we recognize&mdash;"The father of philosophy, at least
of our philosophy, who, rising superior to the darkness
in which he lived, darted his penetrating glance through
all nature, and established principles which a long course
of ages of inquiry have but confirmed. With Aristotle
begins the real History of science: and how much soever
he may have erred upon particular points, the greatness
of his conceptions and the justness of his ideas, on
the whole entitle him to our high veneration. His labours
in the investigation of the Animal Kingdom have
laid the foundation of the knowledge we now possess<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a>."
This language of the lamented and learned President of
the Linnean Society is particularly applicable to what
this great and original genius has effected in <i>Entomology</i>.
We have seen upon a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a>, that
Linné himself had not those precise ideas of the limits
of the Class <i>Insecta</i>, which Aristotle so many centuries
before him had adopted. In stating the obligations of
Entomology to this true <i>sçavant</i>, I shall begin by laying
before you a tabular view of what may be called his
system, as far as I have been able to collect it from his
works, especially his <i>History of Animals</i>.</p>

It may be further stated, that Aristotle perceived also
the distinction between the <i>Mandibulata</i> and <i>Haustellata</i>
of modern authors: for he observes, that some insects
having teeth are omnivorous; while others, that have
only a tongue, are supported by liquid food<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a>. He appears
to have regarded the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, or some of
them, as forming a <i>third</i> subclass; since he clearly
alludes to them, when he says that many have teeth,
not for feeding, but to help them in fulfilling their instincts<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a>.
</p>

<p>
From the above statement it will appear that this great
philosopher had no contemptible notion,&mdash;though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
has only distinguished three of them as larger groups
by appropriate names,&mdash;of the majority of the Orders
of Insects at present admitted. His <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Psychæ</i>,
and <i>Diptera</i> are evidently such. His idea of <i>Hemiptera</i>
seems taken solely from the <i>Cicada</i> or <i>Tettix</i>: but the
manner in which he expresses himself concerning it, as
having no mouth, but furnished instead with a linguiform
organ resembling the proboscis of <i>Diptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a>, proves
that he regarded it as the type of a distinct group. Since
he considers the saltatorious <i>Orthoptera</i> as forming such
a group, it is probable that he included the cursorious
ones with the <i>Neuroptera</i> in his <i>majora</i> section of <i>Tetraptera</i>;
and the resemblance of many of the <i>Mantidæ</i>
to the <i>Neuroptera</i> is so great, that this mistake would
not be wonderful. His division of the <i>Diptera</i> is quite
artificial.
</p>

<p>
How far Aristotle's ideas with regard to genera and
species attained to any degree of precision, is not easily
ascertained: in other respects his knowledge of insects
was more evident. As to their <i>anatomy</i>, he observes
that their body is usually divided into <i>three</i> primary segments,&mdash;<i>head</i>,
<i>trunk</i>, and <i>abdomen</i>; that they have an
<i>intestinal canal</i>,&mdash;in some straight and simple, in others
contorted,&mdash;extending from the mouth to the anus; that
the <i>Orthoptera</i> have a <i>ventricle</i> or gizzard<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>. He had
noticed the <i>drums</i> of <i>Cicada</i>, and that the <i>males</i> only
are vocal. Other instances of the accurate observation
of this great man might be adduced, but enough has
been said to justify the above encomiums. His principal
error was that of equivocal generation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>Little is known with regard to the progress of other
</p>

<p>Greek Naturalists in entomological science. It appears
probable, from an epithet by which Hesiod distinguishes
the spider&mdash;<i>air-flying</i><a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a>, that the fact of these insects traversing
the air was at that time no secret. Apollodorus,
as we learn from Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a>, was the first <i>monographer</i> of
insects, since he wrote a treatise upon scorpions, and
described nine species. But like many other Zoologists,
by mistaking analogy for affinity, he has included
a <i>winged</i> insect, probably a <i>Panorpa</i>, amongst his
scorpions. From the time of Aristotle, however, to
Pliny, no writer is recorded, with the exception of those
before alluded to<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a>, that appears to have attended much
to insects. They are indeed incidentally noticed by Theophrastus,
Dioscorides, Virgil, Ovid, &amp;c., but without
any material addition to the stock of entomological
knowledge bequeathed to us by the Stagyrite. Even
Pliny's vast compendium, as it professed to be, of the
natural history of the globe, was in many respects little
more than a compilation from that great philosopher.
Still, however, though he does not appear to have paid
much practical attention to insects,&mdash;which indeed, considering
the extent of his views, was scarcely to be expected,&mdash;yet
as a guide to the then state of entomological
knowledge, and as an advocate for the study, which
in the exordium of his eleventh book he has so eloquently
and with so much animation defended from the
misrepresentations of ignorance, Pliny has conferred a
lasting obligation on the science. The last zoological
writer of note was Ælian, who amongst other animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
often mentions insects. He has, however, few original
observations. One was, that scorpions are viviparous<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a>.
From him we learn incidentally that artificial flies were
sometimes used by Grecian anglers<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a>.
</p>

2. <i>The Era of the Revival of the Science.</i> From the
time of Pliny and Ælian 1400 years rolled away, in
which scarcely any thing was done or attempted for Entomology
or Natural History in general. During that
long night the glimmer of only one faint luminary appeared
to make a short and feeble twilight. In the
middle of the thirteenth century Albertus Magnus (so
called from his family name of Groot, and justly, if incredible
labour could entitle a man to the appellation),
devoted <i>one</i> out of <i>twenty-one</i> folio volumes to Natural
History. In this work he professes not so much to give
his own opinions, as those of the Peripatetic philosophers<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a>.
He occasionally, however, relates the result of
observations made by himself, which prove him to have
been no inattentive student of nature. He mentions a
voyage that he made for the purpose of collecting marine
animals, and that he found of them ten different
tribes or genera, and several species of each. Amongst
these he particularizes the <i>Cephalopoda</i>, the <i>Crustacea</i>,
the testaceous <i>Mollusca</i>, and some of the <i>Radiata</i> and
<i>Acrita</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> He gives a very correct account of the
pitfalls of <i>Myrmeleon</i>. Insects he distinguishes, excluding
the <i>Crustacea</i>, by the denomination of <i>Anulosa</i> (<i>Annulosa</i>),
which he appears to employ as a <i>known</i> term<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>.
He also calls them <i>worms</i>, describing butterflies as <i>flying</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
<i>worms</i>, flies as <i>fly-worms</i>, spiders as <i>spider-worms</i>; and
what is still more extraordinary, the <i>toad</i> and the <i>frog</i>,
which he includes amongst his <i>Anulosa</i>, he calls <i>quadruped-worms</i><a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a>!!
Though it may appear so absurd to
speak of these animals as insects, yet he had perhaps a
deeper and more philosophical reason for this than
we may at first be disposed to give him credit for.
This would be the case if he separated these from
the other reptiles and placed them amongst insects on
account of their <i>metamorphoses</i>, mistaking perhaps an
analogical character for one of affinity<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>. Some of the
<i>Annelida</i>, as <i>Filaria</i> and <i>Lumbricus</i><a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a>, he also regarded
as insects. I cannot gather from his desultory pages
that he had any notion of a systematical arrangement of
his <i>Anulosa</i>.
</p>

<p>
After the taking of Constantinople by the Turks in
the middle of the fifteenth century, the light of learning,
kindled by those of its professors who escaped from that
ruin, appeared again in the West. The Greek language
then began to be studied universally; and in consequence
of the coeval invention of the art of printing, various
editions of the great works of the ancients were published:
amongst the rest those of the fathers of Natural
History. From the perusal of these, the love of the
sciences of which they treated revived in the West,
and the attention of scientific men began to direct itself
to the consideration and study of the works of their
<span class="smcap">Creator</span>. In the latter part of that century, a work
entitled the <i>Book of Nature</i> appeared in the German
language, in which animals and plants were treated of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
and rudely figured; as they were likewise most miserably
in Cuba's <i>Ortus Sanitatis</i>, published in 1485, in
which insects and <i>Crustacea</i> were described under the
three different denominations of Animals, Birds, and
Fishes; so that but little profit was at first derived from
the writings of Aristotle, Invertebrate animals not being
then even honoured with
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A local habitation and a name."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
This unpromising and apparently hopeless state of the
science proved, however, the dawn of its present meridian
brightness.
</p>

<p>
The first attempt at a separate and systematical arrangement
of insects subsequent to the times of Aristotle,
was made in the ponderous volumes of Ulysses Aldrovandus,
who, disregarding the Stagyrite, arranged insects
according to the medium they inhabit, as you will
see in the subjoined table:

This artificial and meager system, which mixed insects
with <i>Annelida</i>, was adopted by Charlton and other authors;
and even in the eighteenth century had a patron
of great eminence, who, endeavouring to improve upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
it, has rendered it still more at variance with nature and
Aristotle: I mean the celebrated Vallisnieri, to whom
in other respects, though in this he fell behind his age,
the science was under great obligations. He divides
insects into, 1. Those that inhabit <i>vegetable</i> substances
living or dead. 2. Those that inhabit any kind of <i>fluid</i>
and in any state. 3. Those that inhabit any <i>earthy</i> or
<i>mineral</i> substances, <i>dead bones</i>, or <i>shells</i>. And 4. Those
that inhabit <i>living animals</i><a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a>.

The work that is usually called Mouffet's <i>Theatrum
Insectorum</i> was produced in the present era, and was the
fruit of the successive labours of several men of talent.
Dr. Edward Wotton and the celebrated Conrade Gesner
laid the foundation; whose manuscripts falling into
the hands of Dr. Thomas Penny,&mdash;an eminent physician
and botanist of the Elizabethan age<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a>, much devoted to
the study of insect,&mdash;he upon this foundation meditated
raising a superstructure which should include a complete
history of these animals; and with this view he devoted
the leisure hours of fifteen years of his life to the study
of every book then extant that treated of the science
either expressly or incidentally, and to the description
and figuring of such insects as he could procure; but
before he had reduced his materials to order, in 1589 he
was snatched away by an untimely death. His unfinished
manuscripts were purchased at a considerable price by
Mouffet, a contemporary physician of singular learning<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a>,
who reduced them to order, improved the style, added
new matter, and not less than 150 additional figures; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
thus having prepared the work for the press, intended
to dedicate it to queen Elizabeth<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a>. Fate, however,
seemed still to frown upon the undertaking, for before
he could commit his labours to the press he also died,
and his book remained buried in dust and obscurity till
it fell into the hands of Sir Theodore Mayerne, baron
d'Aubone, one of the court physicians in the time of
Charles I., who at length published it, prefixing a Dedication
to Sir William Paddy, baronet, M.D., in 1634;
and it was so well received that an English translation
appeared twenty-four years afterwards. The work thus
repeatedly rescued from destruction was indisputably the
most complete entomological treatise that had then appeared.
And though the arrangement (in which there
is scarcely any attempt at system) is extremely defective,
the figures very rude, often incorrect, and sometimes
altogether false,&mdash;yet as an introduction to the study
of insects its value at that day must have been very
considerable; and as a copious storehouse of ancient
entomological lore, it has not even at present lost its
utility.
</p>

<p>
One of the most remarkable works of the era we are
upon was published at Lignitz in the year 1603, by
Caspar Schwenckfeeld, a physician of Hirschberg, under
the title of <i>Theriotrophium Silesiæ</i>. This was probably
the first attempt at a Fauna that ever was made. In it
animals are divided into quadrupeds, reptiles, birds,
fishes, and insects. The <i>Crustacea</i>, <i>Mollusca</i>, and <i>Zoophytes</i>,
are included under fishes. He says of the <i>Spongiæ</i>
that they are <i>moved</i> by animalcula which inhabit
them<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a>. Did he borrow this observation from Aristotle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
or was it made by himself<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a>? It is singular that Linné
should never allude to this work. Goedart, who belongs
also to this era, is stated to have spent forty years of his
life in attending to the proceedings of insects<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a>. But after
this long study, his principal use to the science was the
improvement he effected in the drawing and engraving
of them,&mdash;for his figures, though sometimes incorrect
and sometimes fabulous, were far superior to those of
his predecessors.

3. <i>The Era of Swammerdam and Ray, or of the</i> Metamorphotic
<i>System</i>. The great men whose names are
here united, as they were cotemporary, so they agreed
in founding their respective systems of insects on the
same basis. To the former, however, is due the merit
of being the first who assumed the <i>metamorphoses</i> of these
animals as the basis of a natural arrangement of them;
upon which the latter, in conjunction with his lamented
friend Willughby, erected that superstructure which
opened the door for the present improved state of the
science. Swammerdam's system may be thus expressed
in modern language:

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>It was a great point gained in the science to introduce
the consideration of the metamorphosis, and to employ
it in the extrication of the natural system: for though
when taken by itself it will, as in the table just given,
lead to an artificial arrangement, it furnishes a very useful
clue when the consideration of insects in their perfect
state is added to it. The tables contained in the <i>Prolegomena</i>
to Ray's <i>Historia Insectorum</i> divide insects
into those which undergo no change of form, and those
which change their form. The arrangement of the
former &#913;&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#969;&#964;&#945; was made by Willughby, who
subdivided them into <i>Apoda</i> and <i>Pedata</i>. As the only
insects included in the former section were the grubs of
<i>&#338;stri</i>, the remainder being <i>Annelida</i>, they need not be
included in our table. I have endeavoured to compress
these tables into as small a space as possible, by using
the Linnean terms for metamorphosis, and reducing
Ray's tribes of <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Hemiptera</i>, and <i>Neuroptera</i>
to their modern denominations.
</p>

<p>
Ray details at considerable length the various tribes
belonging to the four classes of metamorphosis established
by Swammerdam<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a>. Most of his tribes indicate natural
groups of greater or less value: but some of his
larger groups are artificial, as you will see by the mere
inspection of the table.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>This era produced several great and original geniuses,
who enriched the science with a vast increment of real
knowledge. The illustrious Zoologists whose names it
bears,&mdash;the one by his dissections and anatomical researches,
and the other by his concise and well drawn
descriptions of numerous insects, by various interesting
observations on their manners and characters, and by
the purity of his latinity,&mdash;contributed greatly to its progress
towards perfection. Leeuwenhoek also, the compatriot
of Swammerdam, and Hooke of Ray, amongst
other objects submitted to their powerful microscopes,
did not neglect insects.&mdash;To the former we are indebted
for the remarkable discovery that the flea belongs to
those that undergo a metamorphosis. Ray had besides
two coadjutors whose names ought not to be forgotten,&mdash;Willughby
and Dr. Martin Lister. The former is characterized
by his lamenting friend as one of the profoundest
of naturalists, as well as one of the most amiable
and virtuous of men. What advantage Entomology
would have reaped from his labours may be inferred
from the eminent services that he rendered that science,
amongst other branches of Zoology, during his short
life. It appears from Ray's Letters<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>, that he drew up a
history of insects and <i>exsanguia</i>, which probably formed
the groundwork of the posthumous <i>Historia Insectorum</i>
of that author; concerning which he says, "The work
which I have now entered upon is indeed too great a
task for me: I rely chiefly on Mr. Willughby's discoveries
and the contributions of friends<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a>." And indeed
Willughby's name and initials occur so frequently in
that work, that it may be esteemed their joint production.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
Lister by his various writings elucidated many
points relating to insects; and he may be regarded as
the first modern who observed that spiders can sail in
the air. But the most important of his works, and that
on which his fame as an Entomologist is principally
founded, is his admirable treatise <i>De Araneis</i>; in which
his systematic arrangement of these animals leaves far
behind all former attempts, and rivals that of the best
modern Arachnologists. His specific descriptions are
drawn with a precision till then unknown; and each is
headed by a short definition of the species, which he
calls the <i>Titulus</i>, synonymous with the <i>Nomen specificum</i>
of Linné, whose canon of twelve words it rarely exceeds.
</p>

<p>
One of the most important events of this era was the
complete exposure and refutation of the absurd doctrine
of <i>equivocal generation</i>, which had maintained its ground
in the schools of philosophy from the time of Aristotle.
Our own immortal Harvey was the first who dared to
controvert this irrational theory: and his <i>dictum</i>&mdash;<i>Omnia
ex ovo</i>&mdash;was copiously discussed and completely
established by two of the ablest physiologists that Italy
has produced, Redi and Malpighi.
</p>

<p>
Previously to the publication of the <i>Historia Insectorum</i>,
no other works of eminence, with the exception of
Madam Merian's beautiful illustration of the metamorphosis
of the insects of Surinam, made their appearance:
but in the interval of twenty-five years, which elapsed
between the publication of that work and of Linné's
first outline of his <i>Systema Naturæ</i>, Entomologists became
more numerous and active. In England the pious
and learned author of the <i>Physico</i> and <i>Astro-Theology</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
was celebrated for the assiduity with which he studied
insects; and in the former of these works has concentrated
a vast number of interesting observations connected
with their anatomy and history. No Englishman
contributed more to the progress of Natural History,
both as a writer and collector, than that disinterested
physician and naturalist Sir Hans Sloane, whose extensive
and valuable library and well-stored cabinets formed
the original nucleus of the present vast collection of the
British Museum. Amongst other departments, that of
insects was not overlooked by him; and it is to be regretted
that those which he had accumulated have either
perished from neglect or are not accessible. Other
Entomologists were eminent at this period in Britain.
The principal of these were Petiver, Dale (to whom Ray
bequeathed his collection of insects), Bobart, Bradley,
and Dandridge; the last of whom, as Bradley tells us,
delineated and described 140 species of spiders.

<p>
I must not omit here to observe that our <span class="smcap">Royal Society</span>,
the origin of which took place in this era, communicated
a new and powerful impulse to the public mind
in favour of Physical Science, and greatly accelerated
the progress of Natural History. It acted not only as
a centre of excitement which stimulated to exertion, but
also as a focus to collect the scattered rays of light before
they were dissipated. Insulated observations in every
department of nature were thus preserved; and communications
from the most eminent naturalists in various
parts of Europe ornamented its <i>Transactions</i>. So that
from the establishment of this illustrious Society, the
triumphant march of Physical Science of every kind towards
its acme may be dated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>

4. <i>Era of Linné, or of the</i> Alary <i>System.</i> We are now
arrived at that period in the history of Natural Knowledge,
especially of Entomology, in which it received that
form, with respect to its general outline, which, amidst
many lesser mutations, has been preserved ever since.
Swammerdam had altogether deserted the system of
Aristotle, and Ray mixed it with that of his predecessor.
But a brilliant star soon appeared in the North<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a>, which
was destined to be the harbinger of a brighter day than
had ever before illuminated the path of the student of
the works of God. The illustrious philosopher whose
name distinguishes this new era, imbibed a taste for
Entomology almost as early as for Botany<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a>; and though
the latter became his favourite, and absorbed his principal
attention, he did not altogether neglect the former.
In the first edition of his <i>Systema Naturæ</i>, published in
1735, and contained in only <i>fourteen</i> folio pages<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a>, he
began to arrange the three kingdoms of nature after his
own conceptions. But this initiatory sketch, as might
be expected, was very imperfect; and with respect to
insects, instead of an improvement upon his predecessors,
was extremely inferior to what Ray had effected; for he
puts into one Order (to which he gives the name of
<i>Angioptera</i>) the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
and <i>Diptera</i>. In this work, however, Generic Characters
were first given. In successive editions he continued to
improve upon this outline: in the <i>fourth</i> he finally settled
the <i>number</i> and <i>denominations</i> of his Orders; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
in the twelfth (uniting the <i>Orthoptera</i>, which he had at
first considered as of a <i>Coleopterous</i> type, to the <i>Hemiptera</i>)
also their <i>limits</i>. His system, being founded upon
the absence or presence and characters of the organs
for flight, is in some degree a republication of the Aristotelian,
and may be called the <i>Alary</i> System.

<p>
In considering this table, it must strike every one acquainted
with the subject, that although the assumption
of a single set of organs whereon to build a system can
scarcely be expected to lead to one perfectly natural,
yet that the majority of the groups here given as Orders
merit that character. The <i>second</i> indeed and the <i>last</i>
require further subdivision, and concerning the <i>fourth</i>
no satisfactory conclusion has yet been drawn. With
regard to his <i>series</i> of the Orders, it is mostly artificial.
Linné has the advantage of all his predecessors in giving
clearer definitions of his Orders, and in their nomenclature;
in which he has followed the path first trodden
by Aristotle.
</p>

<p>
One of his most prominent excellencies, which led
the way more than any thing else to a distinct knowledge
of natural objects, was his giving definitions of his
genera, or the groups that he distinguished by that name,
since all preceding writers had merely made them known
by the imposition of a <i>name</i>. His generic characters
of insects were of <i>two</i> kinds: A shorter, containing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
supposed <i>essential</i> distinction of the genus, given at the
head of the <i>Class</i>; and another, generally longer, and including
<i>non-essentials</i>, given at the head of the <i>Genus</i>.
The first he denominated the <i>essential</i>, and the latter the
<i>factitious</i> or <i>artificial</i> character. He did not do for insects
what he did for Botany,&mdash;draw up what he has called
the <i>natural</i> character of a genus, which included both the
others, and noticed every other generic distinction<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>.
</p>

<p>
The older Naturalists used to treasure in their memories
a short description of each species, by which when
they wished to speak or write of it they made it known.
Thus, in speaking of the common lady-bird they would
call it "the <i>Coccinella</i> with red <i>coleoptra</i><a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> having seven
black dots." This enunciation of any object was at
first called its Title (<i>Titulus</i>), and afterwards its Specific
Name (<i>Nomen specificum</i>), and by Linné was restricted
to <i>twelve</i> words<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a>. But as the number of species increased
to remember each definition was no easy task; that he
might remedy this inconvenience, he invented what is
called the Trivial Name (<i>Nomen triviale</i>), which expressed
any species by a single term added to its generic
appellation, as <i>Coccinella septem-punctata</i>; and thereby
conferred a lasting benefit on Natural History. This convenient
invention has rendered it less necessary to restrict
the <i>Nomen specificum</i> to twelve words: it is desirable,
however, that the definition of a species should be as
short as possible, and contain only its <i>distinctive</i> characters.
In his definitions and descriptions Linné was often
very happy; but sometimes, in studying to avoid prolixity,
he forgets Horace's hint,
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... "Brevis esse laboro</span>
<span class="i0">Obscurus fio&mdash;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>
and makes his definitions of species, without adding a
description, so extremely short as to suit equally well
perhaps a dozen different insects. The minor groups
into which he has divided some of his Orders and Genera
are sometimes natural, sometimes artificial. Those
of the <i>Coleoptera</i>, from characters drawn from their antennæ
(as is evident from his arrangement of the genera
in that Order), are of the latter description; while
those of his <i>Aptera</i> are more natural. The genera that
he has most happily laboured in this respect are his
Hemipterous ones of <i>Gryllus</i>, <i>Cicada</i>, and <i>Cimex</i>, and all
his <i>Lepidoptera</i>. He had such a tact for discovering natural
groups in general, that in him it seems almost to
have been intuitive.
</p>

<p>
But in no respect were the labours of Linné more beneficial
to the science and to Zoology in general, than
when he undertook to describe the animals of his own
country. His <i>Fauna Suecica</i> is an admirable exemplar,
which ought to stimulate the Zoologists of every country
to make it one of their first objects that its animal productions
shall no longer remain unregistered and undescribed.
Botanists have almost every where been diligent
in effecting this with respect to plants, but other
branches of Natural History have been more neglected.
In his <i>Systema Naturæ</i> Linné attempted this for all the
productions of our globe. The idea was a vast one; and
the execution, though necessarily falling far short of it,
did him infinite honour: and in it he has laid a foundation
for his successors to build upon till time shall be
no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Such were the services rendered to Entomology by
the labours of the immortal Swede; services so extensive
as well as eminent, that had they been the fruit of a whole
life devoted to this single object, they would have entitled
him to a high rank amongst the heroes of the science.
But how much more astonishing are they when
considered but as gleanings from his hours of relaxation,
snatched from labours infinitely greater, the produce, as
he himself tells us, of moments consumed by others in
"venationibus, confabulationibus, tesseris, chartis, lusibus,
compotationibus<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a>." It is not so much in original
discovery that the merits of Linné lie,&mdash;though considered
in this view they are pre-eminent,&mdash;as in the unrivalled
skill with which he sifted the observations of his
predecessors, separating the ore from the dross, and concentrating
scattered rays of light into one focus.
</p>

<p>
This era produced other systematists who adopted
various methods, but none that merit particular notice
except Geoffroy and De Geer. The former in this view
is principally celebrated as the author of the method
generally adopted by modern Entomologists, of dividing
the <i>Coleoptera</i> into primary sections, according to the
number of the joints of their tarsi. This method,
though in many instances, as was formerly observed<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a>, it
leads to artificial results, in others affords a clue to natural
groups; it can only therefore be applied subject to
frequent exceptions. Geoffroy's work<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a>, which was published
in 1764, was further serviceable by indicating
many genera not defined by Linné.</p>

We next come to one of the greatest names in Entomology,
the celebrated De Geer, who united in himself
the highest merit of almost every department of that
science. Both as a systematist, anatomist, and physiologist,
and as the observant historian of the manners
and economy of insects, his <i>Mémoires pour servir
à l'Histoire des Insectes</i> are above all praise. His
system<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> is contained in a posthumous volume published
in 1778<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a>.
</p>

<p>
This system, though built upon the instruments of
flight; in its ternary groups, equivalent to the Orders of
Linné, adds likewise the instruments of manducation,
and is thus intermediate between that of Linné and Fabricius,
who perhaps from the consideration of it might
derive the first idea of assuming the last-mentioned organs
as the basis of a new method. But, though partaking
of both, it is nearer to nature than either; and
had its illustrious author laid less stress upon the number
and substance of the organs of flight, it would probably
have been as near perfection in this respect as most that
have succeeded it. But following too strictly these characters,
he has been led to place in different Classes, or
rather Orders, insects that ought not to have been so separated,&mdash;as
in the case of the two sections of the <i>Hemiptera</i>,
and the <i>Coccidæ</i>. In other respects the whole of
De Geer's <i>Mémoires</i> are a storehouse of valuable observations,
in which he has furnished many a clue for threading
the labyrinth of nature, and given most complete
and interesting histories of the whole economy and habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
of many tribes and genera,&mdash;as of the <i>Trichoptera</i>,
<i>Aphides</i>, <i>Ephemerina</i>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
In this latter department of the science a light shone
during part of the era we are now considering, which
eclipsed every one that appeared before it, and has
scarcely been equalled by any one that succeeded it.
The date of its first appearance, indeed, was a year before
that of Linné's first outline of his <i>Systema Naturæ</i>
before alluded to; but it may properly be regarded as
belonging to his era, since it did not disappear till some
years after that had begun. A volume indeed would
scarcely suffice to do justice to the preeminent merits of
Reaumur, as exhibited in his admirable <i>Mémoires pour
l'Histoire des Insectes</i><a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a>: I must therefore content myself
with observing, that in judgement and ingenuity in planning
his experiments; in patient assiduity in watching
their progress; in the elegance of his language, and the
felicity of his illustrations, he has rarely, if ever, been
equalled. Every subject that he undertook was thoroughly
investigated, and in the true spirit of philosophical
inquiry. Every where you see him the same unprejudiced
and profound observer, attached to no system,
anxious only for truth and the advancement of science.
If he has any fault, it is, perhaps, that of being sometimes
too prolix; but we must recollect that from the nature
of his subject much diffuseness was often necessary
to render his meaning clear. A greater objection is his
total inattention to all system, except with regard to
<i>Lepidoptera</i> and their larvæ<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a>, so that it is often difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
to ascertain the insects whose history he gives. But with
these exceptions, no observer of nature, who wishes his
discoveries to be at once profound and interesting, can
copy a better model or one nearer to perfection.
</p>

<p>
Next to that of Reaumur, the name of his admiring
correspondent Bonnet may be mentioned. This great
physiologist, though still more deficient in systematical
knowledge<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a>, was also an admirable observer of the economy
and manners of insects. In this sense he became
an Entomologist before he was seventeen years of age,
in consequence of an impression made upon him by the
account of the Antlion in that attractive work the <i>Spectacle
de la Nature</i>. From verifying its wonderful history
with his own eyes, he entered with enthusiasm upon
the study of other insects, his observations on which he
regularly communicated to Reaumur. Amongst other
interesting inquiries, his experiments on that singular
anomaly in nature the generation of <i>Aphides</i><a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> do him
the highest credit, and have set that question perfectly
at rest<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a>.
</p>

<p>
In another department of the science this period was
distinguished by a work which may almost be deemed a
prodigy. I am speaking of Lyonet's admirable treatise
on the anatomy of the caterpillar of the Cossus,&mdash;a work
which will uphold his reputation as long as Entomology
shall be cultivated as a science, or the comparative Anatomist
be delighted to trace the footsteps of Divine Wisdom
in the gradually varying structure of animals. The
plates to this publication, executed by the hand of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
excellent author, are as wonderful as the work itself;
and together, to use Bonnet's words, form a <i>demonstration</i>
of the existence of <span class="smcap">God</span>. It is infinitely to be regretted
that the author of this incomparable monument of scientific
ardour and patient industry should have died before
the full completion of his anatomical description of
the <i>pupa</i> and <i>imago</i> of the same insect; of which he had
prepared a considerable portion of the manuscript, and
engraved upwards of twenty of the plates<a name="FNanchor_1404_1404" id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a>.
</p>

<p>
Numerous other writers in various departments of the
science appeared during this era; but it would be useless
to enter into a particular detail of their works and merits.
I cannot however omit noticing, on account of his inimitably
accurate and chastely coloured representations of
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, Sepp's beautiful <i>Nederlandsche Insecten</i>, in
which the whole history of these animals, from the egg
to the fly, is described and portrayed. In our own
country this era was distinguished by no entomological
work of any great eminence. Albin, Wilks, and Harris
produced the principal. Gould, however, without having
any thing of system, gave an admirable account of
English ants, which I formerly noticed<a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a>.
</p>

<p>
One of our first poets, the celebrated Gray, was also
much devoted to Entomology. From his interleaved
copy of the <i>Systema Naturæ</i>, that venerable and able naturalist,
Sir T. G. Cullum, Bart. copied the following
characters of the genera of insects of Linné, drawn up
in Latin Hexameters, which he kindly communicated to
me.

During this era, and by the influence of Linné, in the
year 1739 the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm
was established, which did for Natural History in Sweden
what our own Royal Society had done for it in England.
Other societies, with a similar object, were formed
in different parts of Europe, and were attended by
similar good effects. At Paris, at Berlin, at St. Petersburg,
at Moscow, at Turin, at Lisbon, &amp;c., the lovers
of Nature, at that time and subsequently, have associated
for this purpose; and I may mention here, that I
may not revert to the subject, the great Natural History
association of our own country, <span class="smcap">The Linnean Society</span>,
named after the illustrious Swede, which was first instituted
in 1788, and incorporated by royal charter in
1802. In the <i>Transactions</i> of this learned body, the
Zoologist in general, and particularly the Entomologist,
will find much useful information and many interesting
observations connected with his science. This flourishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
society consists at this time of above 600 members,
of whom more than 500 are Fellows;&mdash;a gratifying proof
how widely Natural History is cultivated in the British
Empire<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a>.
</p>

<p>
5. <i>Era of Fabricius, or of the</i> Maxillary <i>System</i>.&mdash;We
are now arrived, if its consequences be considered, at
one of the most important epochs of the science. Fabricius,
a pupil of Linné, who highly estimated his entomological
acquirements<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a>, thinking that the system of
his master was not built upon a foundation sufficiently
fixed and restricted<a name="FNanchor_1408_1408" id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a>, conceived the idea of doing for
Entomology what the latter had done for Botany. As
the learned and illustrious Swede had assumed the <i>Fructification</i>
for the basis of his system in that science, so
the emulous and highly-gifted Dane, observing how
happily those organs were employed as characters in
extricating the genera of Vertebrate animals, assumed
the <i>instruments</i> of <i>manducation</i>, far more numerous and
various in insects, for the basis of a new system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
Entomology; which, from the <i>maxillæ</i> being principally
employed to characterize the <i>Classes</i> or rather <i>Orders</i>,
may be called the <i>Maxillary</i> System. De Geer, indeed,
as we have seen above, had, in the majority of his
Classes, to the organs of flight added the parts of the
<i>mouth</i>: but Fabricius pursued the idea much further,
and made the <i>Trophi</i><a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a>, or <i>Instrumenta Cibaria</i> as he
called them, the sole corner-stone of his whole superstructure.
Though nothing seems to have been further
from his intention than to follow <i>Nature</i>, since he complains
that Linné by following her too closely had lost
the Ariadnean thread of system<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a>, yet it is singular that,
by building upon this seemingly narrow foundation, he
has furnished a clue, by the due use of which, instead
of deserting her, his successors have been enabled
with more certainty to extricate her groups: since the
parts in question being intimately connected with the
functions and economy of these animals, where they
differ materially, indicate a corresponding difference in
their character and station.
</p>

<p>
The <i>first</i> outline of his System, I believe, appeared in
his <i>Systema Entomologiæ</i> published in 1775; and the <i>last</i>,
in his <i>Supplement</i> to his <i>Entomologia Systematica</i> in 1798.
In this the series and characters of his Classes (for so,
after De Geer, he denominates his primary groups) were
as follows:&mdash;

<p>
The <i>Orders</i> of Fabricius are equivalent usually to the
<i>primary</i> groups of the Linnean Orders, and are regulated
chiefly by the <i>antennæ</i>.
</p>

<p>
In estimating the value of the above system, we must
bear in mind that, according to the statement of its author,
it was intended to be partly artificial and partly
natural: artificial as to its <i>Classes</i> and <i>Orders</i>; natural
as to its <i>genera</i>, <i>species</i>, and <i>varieties</i><a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a>. He admitted,
however, that natural Classes, &amp;c. do exist; but he contended
that artificial ones should be substituted for them,
till further discoveries had cleared the way for their satisfactory
development<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a>. As therefore his system, in
its primary and secondary groups, was confessedly artificial,
and the only use of an <i>artificial</i> system being to
facilitate the study of any department of Natural History,
its value must be estimated by the facilities it affords to
the entomological student. But here, it must be allowed,
that instead of enlarging the entrance to the temple of
his science, it has made it narrower, and has placed
most discouraging impediments in his way.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>If you examine the definitions of his Classes, you will
find them in a variety of cases calculated rather to mislead
than to instruct a learner. Thus that of the <i>Eleutherata</i>
would equally well suit the <i>Piezata</i> and several
others: that of the <i>Piezata</i> is scarcely to be found in it;
since in this the maxilla, instead of being <i>corneous</i>, is usually
<i>coriaceous</i><a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a>, and its lobe sometimes nearly membranous.
In the <i>Unogata</i> he even mistakes the mandibles
for maxillæ. Let any young Entomologist endeavour to
make out the Fabrician class of a <i>Cicindela</i> for instance;
and finding its maxillæ corneous and armed with a claw,
he would conclude that it belonged to the <i>Unogata</i> rather
than to the <i>Eleutherata</i>. Besides all this, the necessity of
examining minute parts not easily come at without dissection,
is very discouraging to a beginner.
</p>

<p>
From hence it is evident, that the system of Fabricius,
considered as an <i>artificial</i> one or a <i>method</i>, was no improvement
upon the classification of his master Linné,
but rather a retrograde movement in the science.
</p>

<p>
As to that part of his system in which he professes to
take <i>nature</i> for his guide, his <i>genera</i>,&mdash;though even with
respect to them he seems fearful of following her too
closely<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a>,&mdash;he certainly has rendered most essential services
to Entomology, and laid the foundation of all that
has since been done for its improvement. But it must be
observed, that the series of his genera is often altogether
artificial; as where he separates and places far asunder the
Saprophagous and Thalerophagous Petalocerous beetles.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>Entomology, however, in other respects was deeply
indebted to this great man. He first, as was lately observed,
directed the attention of her votaries to parts
which enabled them better to follow the chain of affinities,
and to trace out natural groups. In his <i>Philosophia
Entomologica</i>, drawn up on the plan of Linné's <i>Philosophia
Botanica</i>, he bequeathed to the science a standard
work that ought to be studied by every Entomologist.
His incredible labours in defining new genera and describing
new species, with which view he travelled into
various parts of Europe, and <i>seven</i> times into Britain,
have been of infinite service<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a>, and placed the science
upon a footing much nearer to that of Botany than it
had ever before attained.
</p>

<p>
6. <i>Era of Latreille, or of the</i> Eclectic <i>System</i>. The
system of Fabricius, though generally adopted in Germany
and Switzerland, did not meet with a <i>universal</i> reception.
It seems to have gained no permanent footing
in the North of Europe, Britain, or France. In the latter
country the Linnean phraseology and characters of the
Orders were retained by the celebrated Olivier; while at
the same time his definitions of genera were constructed,
after the Fabrician model, upon the antennæ and the
oral organs. But a new and brilliant genius had now
appeared in France, whose indefatigable labours and
singular talents have thrown more light over entomological
science than those of all his predecessors. In 1796,
about two years after Fabricius had completed his <i>Entomologia
Systematica emendata et aucta</i>, M. Latreille published
his <i>Précis de Caractères Génériques des Insectes</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
in which important work, walking in the steps of his
great compatriot Bernard de Jussieu, he disregarded all
<i>artificial</i> systems of Entomology, and attempted to construct
one upon a <i>natural</i> basis: and to this end, uniting
the consideration of the instruments of manducation
with that of the organs for flight and motion, and of
other external characters,&mdash;or the system of Linné with
that of Fabricius,&mdash;he became the founder of the modern
or <i>Eclectic</i> system<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a>; for he judiciously adopted that sensible
<i>dictum</i> of Scopoli, "Classes et Genera naturalia,
non sola <i>instrumenta cibaria</i>, non solæ <i>alæ</i>, nec solæ
<i>antennæ</i> constituunt, sed structura <i>totius</i>, ac cujusque
vel minimi discriminis diligentissima observatio<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a>." His
object has been in the above and subsequent works, by
dividing his Classes into <i>natural</i> Groups, from the Order
to the Genus, to trace out in all its windings, to its inmost
recesses, the perplexing labyrinth of the true system
of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>:&mdash;of what he has effected, the subjoined
tables will give you a sufficient idea<a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a>.

Having given you these tables of the <i>Orders</i>, from a
comparison of which you will be able to trace the improvements
in his system made by this learned Entomologist
in the interval of eight years, I shall proceed to
give those of his subordinate groups arranged under
each. This I have already done, to save space, in the
<i>Arachnida</i> and <i>Insecta aptera</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>

If you examine the <i>Orders</i> as here given, you will
find that they mostly represent <i>natural primary</i> groups
of his Classes, though with regard to their <i>distribution</i>
you may perhaps feel disposed to differ from him. You
will also think that his <i>secondary</i> and <i>minor</i> groups<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a>, with
the exception of some of his sections, merit the same
character. Indeed, he has left far behind all his predecessors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
in the progress that he has made towards extricating
the true system. Setting out from a common
centre he holds on his unwearied course, endeavouring to
trace every set of objects that branches from it to its extreme
term. But though he studied insects <i>analytically</i>
with unrivalled success, he was not always equally happy
in his <i>synthetical</i> arrangement of them. I do not here
so much speak of the result which must necessarily follow
from any arrangement in a <i>series</i>, and which cannot
well be avoided; but I allude particularly to his intire
adoption of the Geoffroyan system in the <i>Coleoptera</i>,
which has prevented him in many instances from seeing
the natural distribution of his groups.

<p>
In 1798, two years after the publication of Latreille's
first enunciation of his system, M. Clairville, a very acute
and learned Swiss Entomologist, drew up the following
analytical table of insects.

Every one will think that the change of the received
names of the Orders, here denominated Sections, is perfectly
needless. The principal merit of this system is the
division of insects, tacitly pointed out by Fabricius, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
two groups or subclasses, from the mode in which they
take their food.

Lamarck,&mdash;whose merits as a Zoologist, except in one
point<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a>, are of the highest order,&mdash;in his <i>Système des Animaux
sans Vertèbres</i>, which was published in 1801, adopts
the above division of insects; but, after Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a>, he
makes the <i>Hymenoptera</i> an intermediate Order between
the masticators and those that take their food by suction;
he places the <i>Lepidoptera</i> at the head of the latter, and
the <i>Aphaniptera</i>, which he denominates <i>Aptera</i>, at the
end<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a>: the Hexapod, Octopod, and Polypod <i>Aptera</i> he

Naturelle des Animaux sans Vertèbres</i>) he includes
the <i>Hymenoptera</i> amongst the masticators, and reverses
the disposition of his Orders, beginning with his <i>Aptera</i>
and ending with the <i>Coleoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a>.

His <i>Gnathaptera</i> include the Isopod <i>Crustacea</i>, the
<i>Arachnida</i>, the Polypod, and some of the Octopod and
Hexapod <i>Aptera</i>; and his <i>Aptera</i>&mdash;<i>Pulex</i>, <i>Pediculus</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
the <i>Acarina</i>, with the exclusion of <i>Hydrachna</i><a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a>. It is
remarkable enough that his Class as it stands, with a
slight alteration, returns into itself, thus forming a circle;
for his first Order (<i>Gnathaptera</i>) contains <i>Hydrachna</i>
and the <i>Thysanura</i>, and his last (<i>Aptera</i>) ends with the
<i>Anoplura</i>, and <i>Acarina</i>.

All the French Entomologists have followed Olivier
and Latreille in adopting, with some variation, Geoffroy's
system with regard to the <i>Coleoptera</i>, which has
rendered them all more or less artificial. Dumeril has
constructed a table of the Order, arranged differently
from that above given<a name="FNanchor_1440_1440" id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a> of Latreille; but not more natural,
for the very same reason.

Our learned countryman, Dr. Leach, by his zoological
labours has thrown much light on the natural distribution
of the Animal Kingdom, and no department
of that kingdom is more indebted to him than the
<i>Annulosa</i>; of which I have before stated to you his
<i>Classes</i><a name="FNanchor_1441_1441" id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a>. I shall now give a table of his <i>Orders</i> of <i>Arachnida</i>
and <i>Insecta</i> Latr. and also his families, &amp;c. of his

I have before expressed my sentiments upon several
of these Orders<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a>: I shall not here repeat them, but shall
merely observe, with respect to those I have not adopted,
that, though perhaps not entitled to rank as <i>Orders</i>,
most of them form natural groups. His Orders, however,
of <i>Arachnida</i> must be excepted from this remark, since
they are evidently artificial. His analyses of his Orders,
though in general they give natural groups, are usually
not carried so far as those of M. Latreille, so as seldom
to indicate what may properly be denominated <i>families</i>.
He has made his nomenclature for his so-called families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
more uniform and satisfactory than that of the French
Entomologist: and we may say, with respect to the extent
and effect of his zoological labours,&mdash;<i>Nihil non
tetigit, et omnia quæ tetigit ornavit</i>.

7. <i>Era of MacLeay, or of the</i> Quinary <i>System.</i> I have
more than once stated to you in my former letters the
bases upon which the system which I am in the last
place to explain to you is built. You know the Sub-kingdoms
and Classes into which its learned and ingenious
author, upon a novel and most remarkable plan, has divided
the Animal Kingdom<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a>. I shall now copy for you
his diagram of the <i>Annulosa</i>.
</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="ANNULOSA" id="ANNULOSA"></a>
   <img src="images/i_484.png" alt="ANNULOSA" title="ANNULOSA" />
   <p class="caption2">ANNULOSA</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
I have before sufficiently noticed these Classes, or
<i>Orders</i> as Mr. MacLeay terms them, of the Sub-kingdom
<i>Annulosa</i>: I shall here therefore only throw out
a few remarks on their composition. With regard to
their <i>circular</i> distribution in the <i>Crustacea</i>, Mr. MacLeay
thinks the series runs from the Branchiopods or <i>Monoculus</i>
L. to the Decapods or <i>Cancer</i> L.; and so on, till by
means perhaps of the genus <i>Bopyrus</i>, which Fabricius regards
as a <i>Monoculus</i>, it returns to the Branchiopods
again. This circle, through <i>Porcellio</i>, a kind of wood-louse,
&amp;c., which has only a pair of antennæ and at first
but six legs, is connected with the <i>Ametabola</i> Class,
which beginning with <i>Glomeris</i> goes by the other <i>Chilognatha</i>
(<i>Iulus</i> L.), having also six legs at first, and certain
<i>Vermes</i> to the <i>Anoplura</i>, and terminates in the <i>Chilopoda</i>
(<i>Scolopendra</i> L.) their cognate tribe<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a>. From the <i>Ametabola</i>
Mr. MacLeay proceeds to the <i>Mandibulata</i>, between
which two groups he has discovered no osculant one, but
he takes the <i>Anoplura</i> of the former as the transit to the
<i>Coleoptera</i> in the latter; from whence passing to the <i>Orthoptera</i>,
&amp;c., he finally returns by the <i>Hymenoptera</i>.
Between the <i>Mandibulata</i> likewise and <i>Haustellata</i> he
finds no osculant class: but as the affinity between the
<i>Trichoptera</i> and <i>Lepidoptera</i> is evident, proceeding by
the <i>Homoptera</i> he returns to the <i>Lepidoptera</i> by certain
<i>Diptera</i>, as <i>Psychoda</i>, &amp;c. From the <i>Aptera</i> Lam. or
<i>Pulex</i> L. he passes by the osculant class <i>Nycteribida</i> to
the <i>Arachnida</i>; and beginning with the <i>Acaridea</i>, he
goes to the <i>Scorpionidea</i>, and so to the <i>Aranidea</i> or spiders,
which he connects with the Decapod <i>Crustacea</i>;&mdash;thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
forming his great circle of <i>five</i> smaller ones, each of
which, as well as that which they form, returns into itself<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a>.
</p>

<p>
We next take his Circles of <i>Mandibulata</i>: thus&mdash;
</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="MANDIBULATA" id="MANDIBULATA"></a>
   <img src="images/i_486.png" alt="MANDIBULATA" title="MANDIBULATA" />
   <p class="caption2">MANDIBULATA</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
In this arrangement of the <i>tribes</i>, as he calls them, of
<i>Mandibulata</i>, Mr. MacLeay sets out from the <i>Coleoptera</i>,
which he distributes, according to the supposed typical
forms of their <i>larvæ</i>, into five minor groups, sufficiently
noticed on a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_1447_1447" id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a>. From this tribe or Order
he proposes to pass by <i>Atractocerus</i> to the osculant Order
<i>Strepsiptera</i>, and from thence by <i>Myrmecodes</i> and the
Ants to the <i>Hymenoptera</i>. From hence he next proceeds
to his <i>Trichoptera</i>; in which, as we have seen<a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a>,
he places not only <i>Phryganea</i> L., but also <i>Tenthredo</i> L.
and <i>Perla</i> Geoffr., making his transit by <i>Sirex</i> L.; forming
an osculant Order which he denominates <i>Bomboptera</i>.
From this his way to the <i>Neuroptera</i> is by the <i>Perlides</i>,
with <i>Sialis</i> as an osculant Order under the name of <i>Megaloptera</i>:
he enters by <i>Chauliodes</i>, and leaves it by
<i>Panorpa</i> or <i>Raphidia</i> by means of <i>Boreus</i>, forming also
an osculant Order (<i>Raphioptera</i>) for the <i>Orthoptera</i>;
which he enters by <i>Phasma</i>, <i>Mantis</i>, &amp;c., and leaves by
<i>Gryllus</i>, entering the <i>Coleoptera</i> again by the osculant
Order <i>Dermaptera</i> formed of <i>Forficula</i> L.: and thus returning
to the point from which he set out<a name="FNanchor_1448_1448" id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a>. He has
not, however, made this return of the series into itself
so clear in each order, excepting in the <i>Orthoptera</i>, as
he has done in the whole Class or Sub-class. Thus in
the <i>Coleoptera</i> there appears no particular affinity between
the Predaceous and Vesicant beetles, his first and
fifth forms<a name="FNanchor_1449_1449" id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a>, or his Chilopodimorphous <i>Coleoptera</i>, and
his Thysanurimorphous.

To enter fully into his doctrine of Analogies would
lead us into a very wide field, and occupy a larger space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
than I can afford; I must therefore refer you to his
work for more particular and detailed information on
that subject. With regard to the analogy between opposite
points of contiguous circles, you may get a very
good idea of it from his diagram of Saprophagous and
Thalerophagous Petalocerous beetles, which I here
subjoin.

<p>
It is a very singular circumstance that in these two
circles we have two sets of insects,&mdash;one <i>impure</i> in its
habits and feeding upon <i>putrescent</i> food, and the other
<i>clean</i> and nourished by food that has suffered no <i>decay</i>,&mdash;set
in contrast with each other, and that in each of the opposite
groups, the one has its counterpart in some respect
in the other. In none is this more striking than the <i>Scarabæidæ</i>
and <i>Cetoniadæ</i>, both remarkable for having soft
membranous mandibles unfit for mastication, and both
living upon juices, the one in a putrescent and the other
in an undecayed state<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
Our learned author in subsequent works has stated
every circle to be resolvable into <i>two</i> superior groups,
which he denominates <i>normal</i> or typical, and <i>three</i> inferior
ones, which he calls <i>aberrant</i> or annectent<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a>.
</p>

<p>
Before I conclude this account of the various <i>general</i>
systems that have distinguished the different entomological
eras, i must say a few words on those <i>partial</i> ones
which have been founded on the <i>neuration</i> of the <i>wings</i>
of insects. Frisch, who died in 1743, attempted something
in this way<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452" id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a>: Harris, in his <i>Exposition of English
Insects</i> published in 1782, had arranged his <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i> according to characters derived from
this same circumstance<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a>: Mr. Jones in the <i>Linnean
Transactions</i> had made good use of it in dividing the
<i>Diurnal Lepidoptera</i> into groups<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a>: and in the <i>Monographia
Apum Angliæ</i>, the characters exhibited by the various
groups into which Linné's genus <i>Apis</i> was resolvable,
as to the neuration of their wings, were described<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a>.
But M. Jurine was the first Entomologist who made that
circumstance the keystone of a system; which indeed he
restricted to Hymenopterous and Dipterous insects, but
which might be extended much further. As this system
has been before sufficiently enlarged upon<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a>, I need here
only mention it.
</p>

<p>
To particularize the various entomological works in
every department of the science, that have appeared since
the commencement of the era of Fabricius, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
require a volume. Such was its progress and spread, that
in every corner of Europe the pens and pencils of able
and eminent men, whose works have almost all been
quoted in the course of our correspondence, have been
employed to illustrate it<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
I may observe, however, that the <i>Internal Anatomy</i> of
Insects, a branch of Entomology which on account of its
difficulty, from the extreme nicety required in dissecting
them, had before been cultivated by scarcely more than a
single student in an age, has now attracted numerous
votaries. In Germany&mdash;Carus, Gaede, Herold, Posselt,
Ramdohr, Rifferschweils, Sprengel, and others, have distinguished
themselves in this arena: and in France, besides
the illustrious Baron Cuvier (himself a host), Marcel de
Serres, Leon Dufour, and very recently, by his elaborate
essays <i>On the Flight of Insects</i> and its wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
apparatus, one of the most acute of anatomical physiologists,
M. Chabrier,&mdash;have all contributed greatly to the
elucidation of this interesting part of the science. In
our own country very little has hitherto been effected
in this line; but a learned Oxford Professor (Kidd) has
presented to the Royal Society an account of the anatomy
of the Mole-cricket, which entitles him to an eminent
station amongst the above worthies.
</p>

<p>
I may likewise further observe, that the <i>pictorial</i> department
of Entomology was, during the period I am
speaking of, carried to its greatest perfection. Painters
of insects formerly were satisfied with giving a representation
generally correct, without attempting a faithful
delineation of all the minor parts, particularly as to
<i>number</i>;&mdash;for instance, the joints of the antennæ and
tarsi, the areolets of the wings, &amp;c.: but now no one
gives satisfaction as an entomological artist unless he is
accurate in these respects.

<h3><i>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF INSECTS;
THEIR STATIONS AND HAUNTS;
SEASONS; TIMES OF ACTION AND REPOSE.</i></h3>

<p>
Though no subject is more worthy of the attention
of the Entomologist than the <i>Geographical Distribution</i>
of insects, yet perhaps there is none connected with the
science, for the elucidation of which he is furnished with
fewer materials. The geographer of these animals sitting
by his fireside, even supposing his museum as amply
stored as that of Mr. MacLeay, and the <i>habitats</i> of its
contents as accurately indicated, still labours under difficulties
that are almost insuperable; so that it is next to
impossible, with our present knowledge of the subject,
to give <i>satisfactory</i> information upon <i>every</i> point which
it includes. Had he the talents and opportunities of a
Humboldt, and could, like him, traverse a large portion
of the globe, he would endeavour to note the elevation,
the soil and aspect, the latitude and longitude, the mean
temperature and meteorological phænomena, the season
of the year, the kind of country, and other localities connected
with the insects he captured, and so might build
his superstructure upon a sure basis. But these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
things seldom registered by travellers that take the
trouble to collect insects; who, if they specify generally
the country in which any individual was found, think
they have done enough. But to say that an insect was
taken in India, China, New Holland, and North or
South America,&mdash;when we consider the vast extent of
those regions,&mdash;is saying little of what one wishes to
know even with respect to its <i>habitat</i>. You must regard
therefore, after all, what I have been able to collect,&mdash;and
for which I am greatly indebted to the labours
of my few but able precursors in this walk,&mdash;as merely
approximations to an <i>outline</i>, rather than as a correct
<i>map</i> of insect Geography.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the numerous obligations that he conferred
upon Natural History, Linné was the first Naturalist
who turned his attention to the <i>Geographical Distribution</i>
of its objects, especially that of the <i>Vegetable</i> Kingdom<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a>:
and the accomplished traveller Baron Humboldt,
by the observations he made on this subject in
the course of his peregrinations in tropical America,
has furnished the Botanist with a clue which, duly followed,
will enable him to perfect that part of his science;
an end to which the learned observations of Messrs.
R. Brown and Decandolle have greatly contributed<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a>.
With regard to <i>animals</i>, Mr. White, so long ago as
1773, had observed that they, as well as plants, might
with propriety be arranged geographically<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a>: and in 1778
Fabricius in his <i>Philosophia Entomologica</i> applied the
principle to <i>insects</i><a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a>. Nearly forty years elapsed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
any improvement or enlargement of this last department
was attempted; when in 1815 M. Latreille, stimulated
by what had been effected in Botany, in a learned and
admirable memoir<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> endeavoured to place Entomology
in this respect by the side of her more fortunate sister:
and subsequently Mr. W. S. MacLeay, in the memorable
work so often quoted in our correspondence, has
viewed the subject in another light, and added some
important information to what had been before collected<a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a>.
</p>

<p>
The point now under consideration naturally divides
itself into two principal branches;&mdash;the <i>numerical</i> distribution
of insects, and the <i>topographical</i>.
</p>

<p>
I. By the <i>numerical</i> distribution of insects I mean
not only the number which <span class="smcap">Providence</span> has employed
to carry on its great plan on this terraqueous globe, or
any given portion of it; or of the species of which each
group or genus may be supposed to consist; or of the
comparative number of individuals furnished by each
species,&mdash;points of no easy solution: but more particularly
their distribution according to their <i>functions</i>,
whether they prey upon <i>animal</i> or <i>vegetable</i> matter, and
in its <i>living</i> or <i>decaying</i> state.
</p>

<p>
We have no data enabling us to ascertain with any
degree of accuracy the actual <i>number</i> of species of insects
and <i>Arachnida</i> distributed over the surface of the
globe; but it is doubtless regulated in a great degree by
that of plants. We should first then endeavour to gain
some just though general notion on that head. Now
Decandolle conjectures that the number of the species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
of plants, 60,000 being already known, may be somewhere
between 110,000 and 120,000<a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a>. If we consider
with reference to this calculation, that though the great
body of the mosses, lichens, and sea-weeds are exempt
from the attack of insects, yet as a vast number of phanerogamous
plants and fungi are inhabited by <i>several</i> species,
we may form some idea how immense must be the number
of existing insects; and how beggarly does Ray's conjecture
of 20,000 species<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a>, which in his time was reckoned
a magnificent idea, appear in comparison! Perhaps we
may obtain some approximation by comparing the number
of the species of insects already discovered in <i>Britain</i>
with that of its <i>phanerogamous</i> plants. The latter,&mdash;and it
is not to be expected that any large number of species have
escaped the researches of our numerous Botanists,&mdash;may
be stated in round numbers at 1500, while the British insects,
(and <i>thousands</i> it is probable remain still undiscovered,)
amount to 10,000; which is more than <i>six</i> insects
to <i>one</i> plant. Now though this proportion, it is probable,
does not hold universally; yet if it be considered how
much more prolific in species tropical regions are than
our chilly climate, it may perhaps be regarded as not
very wide of a fair medium. If then we reckon the phanerogamous
vegetables of the globe in round numbers at
100,000 species, the number of insects would amount to
600,000. If we say 400,000, we shall perhaps not be
very wide of the truth. When we reflect how much
greater attention has been paid to the collection of
plants than to that of insects, and that 100,000 species
of the latter may be supposed already to have a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
in our cabinets<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a>, we may very reasonably infer that at
least <i>three fourths</i> of the existing species remain undiscovered.
</p>

<p>
Certain groups and genera are found to contain many
more species than others: for instance, the <i>Coleoptera</i>
and <i>Lepidoptera</i> Orders than the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Neuroptera</i>;
the <i>Rhincophora</i> than the <i>Xylophagi</i>: the <i>Dytiscidæ</i>
than the <i>Gyrinidæ</i>; <i>Aphodius</i> than <i>Geotrupes</i>;
<i>Carabus</i> than <i>Calosoma</i>. Again, some insects are much
more prolific than others. Thus the <i>Diptera</i> Order,
though not half so numerous with respect to <i>species</i>
as the <i>Coleoptera</i>, exceeds it greatly in the number
of <i>individuals</i>, filling the air in every place and almost
at every season with its dancing myriads. We rarely
meet with a single individual of the most common species
of <i>Calosoma</i> or <i>Buprestis</i>; whilst the formicary, the
termitary, the vespiary, and the bee-hive send forth
their thousands and tens of thousands; and whole countries
are covered and devastated by the <i>Aphides</i> and the
Locusts. An all-wise <span class="smcap">Providence</span> has proportioned
the numbers of each group and species to the work assigned
to them. And this is the view in which the numerical
distribution of insects is most interesting and
important: and we are indebted to Mr. W. S. MacLeay
for calling the attention of Entomologists more particularly
to this part of our present subject.
</p>

<p>
With regard to their <i>functions</i>, insects may be primarily
divided into those that feed upon <i>animal</i> matter
and those that feed upon <i>vegetable</i>. At first you would
be inclined to suppose that the <i>latter</i> must greatly exceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
the <i>former</i> in number: but when you reflect that
not only a very large proportion of Vertebrate animals,
and even some <i>Mollusca</i><a name="FNanchor_1467_1467" id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a>, have more than <i>one</i> species
that preys upon them, but that probably the majority of
insects, particularly the almost innumerable species of
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, are infested by parasites of their own class,
sometimes having a different one appropriated to them
in each of their preparatory states<a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a>, and moreover that
a large number of beetles and other insects devour both
living and dead animals,&mdash;you will begin to suspect that
these two tribes may be more near a counterpoise than
at first seemed probable. In fact, out of a list of more
than 8000 British insects and <i>Arachnida</i> taken several
years ago, and furnished chiefly by Mr. Stephens, I found
that 3894 might be called carnivorous, and 3724 phytiphagous<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a>;
so that, speaking roundly, they might be denominated
equiponderant.
</p>

<p>
Carnivorous and phytiphagous insects may be further
subdivided according to the <i>state</i> in which they take
their <i>food</i>,&mdash;whether they attack it while <i>living</i>, or not
till after it is <i>dead</i>. To adopt Mr. W. S. MacLeay's
phraseology, the former may be denominated <i>thalerophagous</i>,
and the latter <i>saprophagous</i>. The British saprophagous
<i>carnivorous</i> insects, compared with those
that are thalerophagous, are about as 1:6; while the
phytiphagous ones are as 1:9. The <i>thalerophaga</i> in
both tribes may be further subdivided as they take their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
food by <i>suction</i> or <i>mastication</i>: in the <i>carnivorous</i> ones, the
suckers to the masticators in Britain are nearly as 1:6;
but with respect to the <i>phytiphagous</i> tribe you must take
into consideration that some insects imbibing their food
by <i>suction</i> in their <i>perfect</i> state (as the great body of the
<i>Lepidoptera</i>), <i>masticate</i> it when they are <i>larvæ</i>: deducting
therefore from both sides the insects thus circumstanced,
the masticators will form about <i>three fourths</i> of the remaining
British thalerophagous insects. Another circumstance
belonging to this head must not be passed
without notice:&mdash;there are certain insects feeding upon
liquid food that do not <i>suck</i>, but <i>lap</i> it. This is the case
with the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, who, though they are mandibulate,
generally lap their food (the nectar of flowers) with their
tongue, and may be called <i>lambent</i> insects: nor is this
practice confined to that order, but all the mandibulate
insects that feed on that substance merit the same appellation.
The absorption of this nectar is so important a
point in the economy of nature, that a very large proportion
of the insect population of the globe in their perfect
state, are devoted to it. Considerably more than half
the species indigenous to Britain fulfill this function,
and probably in tropical countries the proportion may
be still larger.
</p>

<p>
To push this analysis still further&mdash;Amongst our carnivorous
thalerophaga, <i>aphidivorous</i> insects are about as
1:14; and amongst the phytiphagous, the <i>fungivorous</i>
ones form about a <i>twentieth</i>; and the <i>granivorous</i> about
a <i>twenty-fifth</i> part of the whole. Again: in the <i>saprophaga</i>
the <i>lignivorous</i> tribes form more than <i>half</i>, and
the <i>coprophagous</i> ones more than a <i>third</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to know further the relative proportions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
of the different <i>Orders</i> to each other&mdash;The <i>Coleoptera</i>
may be stated as forming at least 1:2 of our intire insect
population; the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Dermaptera</i> as about
1:160; the <i>Hemiptera</i> as 1:15; the <i>Lepidoptera</i> as more
than 1:4; the <i>Neuroptera</i> with the <i>Trichoptera</i> as 1:29;
the <i>Hymenoptera</i> as about 1:4; the <i>Diptera</i> as not 1:7;
and the <i>Aptera</i> and <i>Arachnida</i> as perhaps amounting to
1:19<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a>.
</p>

<p>
To extend this inquiry to <i>exotic</i> and more particularly
to <i>extra-European</i> insects, in the present state of our
knowledge, would lead to no very satisfactory results.
The lists we have are so imperfect, that those which tell
most in this country,&mdash;I mean the more minute insects
and the <i>Brachyptera</i>&mdash;have hitherto formed a very small,
if any part, of the collections made <i>out</i> of Europe.
Mr. W. S. MacLeay however, who, besides his father's
(particularly rich in <i>Petalocera</i>), has had an opportunity
of examining the Parisian and other cabinets, finds that
the species of <i>coprophagous</i> insects <i>within</i> the tropics, to
those <i>without</i>, are nearly in the proportion of 4:3; and
that the coprophagous <i>Petalocera</i>, to the remainder of
the saprophagous ones, may be represented by 3:2<a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a>.
It may be inferred, from the superabundance of plants
and animals in equinoctial countries, that the number of
species of insects in general is greater within than without
the tropics: the additional momentum produced by
the vast size of many of the tropical species must also be
taken into consideration.
</p>

<p>
II. There are three principal points that call for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
attention under the <i>second</i> branch of our present subject&mdash;the
<i>topographical</i> distribution of insects; namely, their
<i>Climates</i>, their <i>Range</i>, and their <i>Representation</i>.
</p>

<p>
i. Entomologists, taking <i>heat</i> for the principal regulator
of the station of insects, have divided the globe
into entomological <i>climates</i>. Fabricius considers it as
divisible into <i>eight</i> such climates, which he denominates
the <i>Indian</i>, <i>Egyptian</i>, <i>Southern</i>, <i>Mediterranean</i>, <i>Northern</i>,
<i>Oriental</i>, <i>Occidental</i>, and <i>Alpine</i>. The first containing
the tropics; the second, the northern region immediately
adjacent; the third, the southern; the fourth, the countries
bordering on the Mediterranean sea, including also
<i>Armenia</i> and <i>Media</i>; the fifth, the northern part of
Europe interjacent between Lapland and Paris; the
sixth, the northern parts of Asia where the cold in winter
is intense; the seventh, North America, Japan, and
China; and the eighth, all those mountains whose summits
are covered with eternal snow<a name="FNanchor_1472_1472" id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a>. M. Latreille objects
to this division, as too vague and arbitrary and not
sufficiently correct as to temperature; and observes, with
great truth, that as places where the temperature is the
same, have different animals, it is impossible, in the actual
state of our knowledge, to fix these distinctions of climates
upon a solid basis. The different elevations of
the soil above the level of the sea, its mineralogical composition,
the varying quantity of its waters, the modifications
which the mountains, by their extent, their height,
and their direction, produce upon its temperature; the
forests, larger or smaller, with which it may be covered;
the effects of neighbouring climates upon it,&mdash;are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
elements that render calculations on this subject very
complicated, and throw a great degree of uncertainty over
them<a name="FNanchor_1473_1473" id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a>. This learned Entomologist would judiciously
consider entomological climates under another view,&mdash;that
which the genera of <i>Arachnida</i> and insects <i>exclusively</i>
appropriated to determinate spots or regions would supply<a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a>.
Linné's <i>dictum</i> with regard to genera will here also
apply; "Let the insects point out the climate, and not the
climate the insects." If you expect invariably to find the
same insects within the same parallels of latitude, you
will be sadly disappointed; for, as our author further
observes, "The totality or a very large number of
<i>Arachnida</i> and insects, the temperature and soil of whose
country are the same, but widely separated, is in general,
even if the countries are in the same parallel, composed
of different species<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a>." The natural limits of a
country,&mdash;as mountainous ranges, rivers, vast deserts,
&amp;c.,&mdash;often also say to its insect population, "No
further shall ye come;" interposing a barrier that it never
passes<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a>. Humboldt observes, with respect to the <i>Simulia</i>
and <i>Culices</i> of South America, that their geographical
distribution does not appear to depend solely on the <i>heat</i>
of the climate, the excess of humidity, or the thickness
of forests; but on local circumstances that are difficult
to characterize<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a>: and Mr. W. S. MacLeay makes a
similar observation upon that of <i>Gymnopleurus</i><a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>. So
that the real insect climates, or those in which certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
groups or species appear, may be regarded as fixed by
the will of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, rather than as certainly regulated
by any <i>isothermal</i> lines. Still, however, under
certain limitations, it must be admitted that the temperature
has much to do with the station of insects. The
increase of caloric is always attended with a proportional
increase in the number and kind of the groups and
species of these beings. If we begin within the polar
regions of ice and snow, the list is very meager. As we
descend towards the line, their numbers keep gradually
increasing, till they absolutely <i>swarm</i> within the tropics.
Something like this takes place in miniature upon <i>mountains</i>.
Tournefort long since observed at the summit of
Mount Ararat the plants of Lapland; a little lower, those
of Sweden; next, as he descended, those of Germany,
France, and Italy; and at the foot of the mountain, such
as were natural to the soil of Armenia. And the same
has been observed of insects. Those that inhabit the
<i>plains</i> of <i>northern</i> regions have been found on the <i>mountains</i>
of more <i>southern</i> ones; as the beautiful and common
Swedish butterfly <i>Parnassius Apollo</i>, on the mountains
of France, and <i>Prionus depsarius</i> on those of
Switzerland<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a>.

<p>
M. Latreille, having given a rapid survey of the
peculiar insect-productions of different countries, next
attempts a division of the globe into <i>climates</i>, which he
thinks may be made to agree with the present state of
our knowledge, and be even applicable to future discoveries.
He proposes dividing it primarily into <i>Arctic</i>
and <i>Antarctic</i> climates, according as they are situated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
<i>above</i> or <i>below</i> the equinoctial line; and taking twelve
degrees of latitude for each climate, he subdivides the
whole into <i>twelve</i> climates. Beginning at 84° N. L. he
has <i>seven Arctic</i> ones, which he names <i>polar</i>, <i>subpolar</i>,
<i>superior</i>, <i>intermediate</i>, <i>supratropical</i>, <i>tropical</i>, and <i>equatorial</i>:
but his <i>antarctic</i> climates, as no land has been
discovered below 60° S. L., amount only to <i>five</i>, beginning
with the <i>equatorial</i> and terminating with the
<i>superior</i>. He proposes further to divide his climates
into <i>subclimates</i>, by means of certain <i>meridian lines</i>; separating
thus the <i>old</i> world from the <i>new</i>, and subdividing
the <i>former</i> into two great portions,&mdash;an <i>eastern</i>,
beginning with <i>India</i>, and a <i>western</i>, terminating with
<i>Persia</i>. He proposes further that each climate should
be considered as having 24° of longitude, as well as 12°
of latitude<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a>. In this chart of insect Geography he
states that he has endeavoured to make his climates agree
with the actual distribution of insects<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a>; and it should
seem that in many cases such an agreement actually does
take place: yet the division of the globe into climates by
<i>equivalent</i> parallels and meridians, wears the appearance
of an artificial and arbitrary system, rather than of one
according with nature.
</p>

<p>
He has also pointed out another index to insect climates,
borrowed from the <i>Flora</i> of a country. Southern
forms in Entomology, he observes, <i>commence</i> where the
<i>vine</i> begins to prosper by the sole influence of the mean
temperature; that they are <i>dominant</i> where the <i>olive</i> is
cultivated; that species still <i>more</i> southern are compatriots
of the <i>orange</i> and <i>palmetto</i>; and that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
<i>equatorial</i> genera accompany the <i>date</i>, the <i>sugar-cane</i>, the
<i>indigo</i> and <i>banana</i><a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a>. The idea is very ingenious, and,
under certain limitations, supplies a useful and certain
criterion. For though none of these plants are <i>universal</i>
in isothermal parallels of latitude; yet, as plants are
more conspicuous than insects, the Entomologist, furnished
with an index of this kind, may by it be directed
in his researches for them; and in all countries
in which there is a material change of the climate, as
in France, there will be a proportional change in the
<i>vegetable</i> accompanied by one in the <i>insect</i> productions.
</p>

<p>
ii. In considering the <i>range</i> of insects I shall first advert
to that of <i>individual</i> species. At the extreme limits
of phanerogamous vegetation we find a species of humble-bee
(<i>Bombus arcticus</i>), which, though it is not known
to leave the Arctic circle, has a very extensive range to
the <i>westward</i> of the meridian of Greenwich, having been
traced from Greenland to Melville Island; while to the
<i>eastward</i> of that meridian it has not been met with. In
Lapland its place appears to be occupied by <i>B. alpinus</i>
and <i>lapponicus</i>, with the former of which, though quite
distinct, it was confounded by O. Fabricius; but whether
these range further <i>eastward</i> of that meridian has
not been ascertained. From its being found in the
Lapland <i>Alps</i><a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a>, it may be conjectured that <i>B. alpinus</i>
ranges as high on this side as <i>B. arcticus</i> on the other,
and may perhaps be found in <i>Nova Zembla</i>. Some
species that have been taken in Arctic regions are not
confined to them. Of this kind is <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
which appears common in Greenland, abundant in Britain,
and is dispersed over all Europe; while <i>D. latissimus</i>
is more confined, neither ranging so far to the
north or south; and though found in Germany, not yet
discovered in Britain. Other species have a still more
extensive range, and are common to the old world and
the new. Thus <i>Dermestes murinus</i>, <i>Brachinus crepitans</i>,
<i>Tetyra scarabæoides</i><a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a>, <i>Pentatoma juniperina</i>, <i>Cercopis
spumaria</i>, <i>Vanessa Antiopa</i>, <i>Polyommatus Argiolus</i>, <i>Hesperia
Comma</i>, <i>Vespa vulgaris</i>, <i>Ophion luteus</i>, <i>Helophilus
pendulus</i>, <i>Oscinis Germinationis</i>, and many besides,
though sometimes varying slightly<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a>, inhabit both Britain
and Canada: and though vast continents and oceans
intervene between us, New Holland, and Japan; yet all
have some insect productions in common. With the
former we possess the painted-lady butterfly (<i>Cinthia
Cardui</i>), with scarcely a varying streak: and Thunberg,
in his list of Japan insects, has mentioned more than
<i>forty</i> species that are found also in this country. Whether
any species has a <i>universal</i> range may be doubted,
unless indeed the flea and the louse may be excepted.
On the other hand, some are confined within very narrow
limits. <i>Apion Ulicis</i> for instance, abundant upon
<i>Ulex europæus</i> in Britain, has not, I believe, been found
upon that plant on the continent.
</p>

<p>
The geographical distribution of <i>groups</i>, is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
far more interesting than that of <i>individual species</i>: for
in considering this we see more evidently how certain
<i>functions</i> are devolved upon certain <i>forms</i>, and can scan
the great plan of <span class="smcap">Providence</span>, in the creation of insects,
more satisfactorily than by confining our attention to
the latter. Groups, according to their range, may be
denominated either <i>predominant</i>, <i>dominant</i>, <i>sub-dominant</i>,
or <i>quiescent</i>.
</p>

<p>
1. M. Latreille has observed, that where the empire
of <i>Flora</i> ceases, there also terminates that of Zoology<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a>.
<i>Phytiphagous</i> animals can only exist where there are
<i>plants</i>; and those that are <i>carnivorous</i> and feed upon the
<i>former</i>, must of necessity stop where they stop. Even
the <i>gnat</i>, which extends its northern reign so high<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a>,
must cease at this limit; while, where vegetation is the
richest and most abundant, there the animal productions,
especially the insect, must be equally abundant. I call
that, therefore, a <i>predominant</i> group, members of which
are found in all the countries between these points, or
from the limits of animal-depasturing vegetation in the
polar regions to the line.
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, the <i>carnivorous</i> insects, whether
thalerophagous or saprophagous, are of this description.
<i>Calosoma</i>, which devours Lepidopterous larvæ, though
poor in species and individuals, is widely scattered. Captain
Frankland found <i>C. calidum</i> in his Arctic journey;
<i>C. laterale</i> and <i>curvipes</i> inhabit tropical America<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a>: <i>C.
Chinense</i>, as its name indicates, is Chinese<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a>; Mr. MacLeay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
has an undescribed species from New Holland;
and <i>C. retusum</i> was taken in Terra del Fuego. Another
genus, equally universal and richer in numbers, is the
lady-bird (<i>Coccinella</i>), which keeps within due limits the
<i>Aphides</i> of every climate from pole to pole. The <i>Libellulina</i>
pursue their prey both in Greenland and New
Holland. The <i>saprophagous</i> carnivora are also similarly
predominant;&mdash;the <i>Silphidæ</i>, the <i>Dermestidæ</i>, the <i>Brachyptera</i>,
the <i>Muscidæ</i>, prey on carcases wherever the
action of the solar beam causes them to become putrid.
Many of the above insects have probably their <i>capital</i>
station, or that where the species are most numerous, in
or near the tropics; but the metropolis of the <i>Brachyptera</i>,
at least as far as we can judge from our present
catalogues, is within the temperate zone, particularly in
Britain<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a>. The coprophagous <i>Petalocera</i> are most abundant
in the hottest climates; but the <i>Aphodiadæ</i> form a
predominant group: Professor Hooker took one species
in Iceland<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a>, and it probably ascends higher; others are
found in India and China: but the metropolis of the
group is within the temperate zone. Perhaps no genus
is more completely universal than <i>Bombus</i> (<i>Bremus</i> Jur.),
which, although its centre or <i>metropolis</i> is likewise in
the northern temperate zone, extends from Melville
Island to the line. It is remarkable that some of the
tropical <i>Bombi</i> wear the external aspect of <i>Xylocopæ</i>,
the kindred genus most prevalent in warm climates; and,
<i>vice versâ</i>, some <i>Xylocopæ</i> resemble <i>Bombi</i>. I have a
Brazilian undescribed species of the latter genus, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
black body and violet-coloured wings would almost
cause it to be mistaken for a variety of <i>X. violacea</i>; and
<i>B. antiguensis</i> and <i>caffrus</i> F., (though their aspect belies
it,) which misled Fabricius, are true <i>Xylocopæ</i>. I shall
mention only one other predominant group, but that one
of no common celebrity, formed of the gnats, or genus
<i>Culex</i>. These piping pests, with their quiver&mdash;"venenatis
gravida sagittis"&mdash;annoy man almost from the pole
to the line. What remarkably distinguishes them, (as
was formerly observed<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a>,) and also the <i>Simulium</i> or true
mosquito,&mdash;they appear to prevail most in the coldest
and the hottest climates, and the Laplander and the tropical
American are equally their prey; while the inhabitants
of the temperate zone, with some exceptions, suffer
but little from them: so that they may be stated to
have both an <i>arctic</i> and a <i>tropical</i> metropolis.
</p>

<p>
2. There are other groups which, though their empire
extends to the tropics, fall short of the polar circles:&mdash;these
I call <i>dominant</i> groups. Of this description are
some of the <i>Scarabæidæ</i>. <i>Onthophagus</i> is found both
in the old world and in the new, and in the temperate
and torrid zones. Its principal seat appears to be within
the tropics, but it may almost be said to have also a
northern metropolis. More than one species have been
taken in New Holland. In general, tropical insects
exceed those of colder climates in <i>size</i>; but in the genus
we are speaking of, the <i>European</i> species are usually
larger than the <i>Indian</i>. <i>Copris</i> seems more abhorrent
of cold than its near relation <i>Onthophagus</i>. <i>C. lunaris</i>,
which ranges northward as far as Sweden, is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
recorded species found in Europe out of Spain. Latreille
says, that all the large species of this genus are
equinoctial: but <i>C. Tmolus</i>, described and figured by
Fischer<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a>, found in Asia near Orenburg, north of 50° N. L.,
is as big as <i>C. Gigas</i> or <i>bucephalus</i>. Another dominant
group of <i>Petalocera</i>, remarkable for the bulk and arms
of its tropical species, are the mighty <i>Dynastidæ</i>, the
giants and princes of the insect race. Though their
metropolis is strictly tropical, yet the scouts of their host
have wandered even as far as the south of Sweden, where
one of them, <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>, is extremely common.
<i>O. Grypus</i><a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a> and some other species are found in South
Europe; but though in a torpid state they can endure
unhurt the severity of a Scandinavian winter, they cannot
when revived stand the cold that often pinches Britons
in the midst of summer, and therefore are unknown in
our islands<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a>. The <i>Sphæridiadæ</i>, whose metropolis is
within the northern temperate zone, extend from thence
beyond the line, since Dr. Horsfield found two species
in Java<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a>. It is probable, indeed, that this group is predominant.
Some dominant groups begin at a lower latitude.
Of this description are the carpenter-bees (<i>Xylocopa</i>),
whose larvæ are preyed upon by that of the <i>Horiadæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a>
under <i>two</i> forms, which extend from the tropics
to about 50° N. L. Others are not common to both
worlds. Thus, while <i>Cantharis</i> is the gift of <span class="smcap">Providence</span>
to America as well as the old world, <i>Mylabris</i> is confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
to the <i>latter</i>, where its range is very extensive;&mdash;in
Europe, from South Russia to Italy and Spain; in
Asia, from Siberia to India; and in Africa, from the
shores of the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope;
which last continent, to judge from our present lists, especially
the vicinity of the Cape, may be called the metropolis
of the group<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a>. On the other hand, the <i>Rutelidæ</i>
and <i>Chlamys</i>, which have a range from Canada to the
tropics, (within which is their metropolis,) are purely
<i>American</i> groups. Many more might be named under
this head, but these will suffice for examples.
</p>

<p>
3. I call those <i>subdominant</i> groups, which either never
enter the tropics, or those tropical ones whose range
does not exceed 50° of N. L. in the old world, or
43° in the new. I make this difference because, as
M. Latreille observes, the southern insects which in
Europe begin between 48° and 49° N. L., in America do
not reach 43°.<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> But though the winters in Canada,
within the same parallel as France, are longer and more
severe than those even of Great Britain or of Germany,
yet the summers are intensely hot; so that though tropical
<i>species</i> do not range so high, those of a tropical
<i>structure</i>, as Mr. W. S. MacLeay has intimated<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a>, may
be found at a higher latitude in the new world than in
Europe.
</p>

<p>
The genus <i>Melöe</i> affords an instance of a subdominant
group of the first description. It ranges from Sweden
to Spain and the shores of the Mediterranean, and
seems a tribe almost confined to Europe, where it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
very unequally distributed. Of registered species Britain
possesses the largest proportion; but Mr. W. S. MacLeay
is of opinion that Spain is its true metropolis<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a>. I have
a species of this genus, taken in North America by Professor
Peck. The splendid genus <i>Carabus</i> ranges still
further north than <i>Melöe</i><a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a>. A very fine species (<i>C. cribellatus</i>)
inhabits the polar regions of Siberia<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>; but
the metropolis of the group appears to be the temperate
zone: some, however, have been found in northern
Africa; and Sir Joseph Banks captured one in Terra del
Fuego. Of those whose range is between the tropics
and 50° N. L. we may begin with <i>Cicada</i>. One species,
indeed, has been found by Mr. Bydder and others, a
little higher, near the New Forest, Hampshire. We
may take <i>Scolia</i> for an example of a subdominant group
beginning more southward. Its species first appear
about 43° N. L., and abound in warm climates. In
general most of those insects which M. Latreille denominates
<i>meridional</i>,&mdash;such as <i>Scarabæus</i>, <i>Onitis</i>, <i>Brentus</i>,
<i>Scarites</i>, <i>Mantis</i>, <i>Fulgora</i>, <i>Termes</i>, <i>Scorpio</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;come
under the present head, and in fact all tropical forms
that wander to any distance within the above limits from
their metropolis.
</p>

<p>
4. By <i>quiescent</i> groups I mean those that have none,
or no <i>high</i> range as to latitude, from their centre or metropolis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
I say as to <i>latitude</i>, because these groups have often
an extensive one as to <i>longitude</i>. Thus, Mr. W. S. MacLeay
has remarked to me, that <i>Goliathus</i> appears to
belt the globe, but not under <i>one</i> form. The types of the
genus are the vast African Goliaths (<i>G. giganteus</i>, &amp;c.),
which, as well as <i>G. Polyphemus</i>, and another brought
from Java by Dr. Horsfield, have, like <i>Cetonia</i><a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a>, the scapulars
interposed between the posterior angles of the
prothorax and the shoulders of the elytra<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a>: while the
South American species (<i>G. micans</i>, &amp;c.) have not this
projection of the scapulars; in this resembling <i>Trichius</i>.
Mr. MacLeay further observes, that the female of the
Javanese <i>Goliathus</i> is exactly a <i>Cetonia</i>, while that of the
Brazilian is a <i>Trichius</i>. But quiescent groups have not
generally this ample longitudinal range. Thus, <i>Euglossa</i>,
in both its types,&mdash;one represented by <i>Eu. cordata</i>,
and the other by <i>Eu. surinamensis</i>,&mdash;is confined to
the tropical regions of America. <i>Doryphora</i>, likewise
American, seems equally confined. <i>Asida</i>, though a
<i>southern</i> genus, is not found to enter the <i>tropics</i>; and
<i>Manticora</i> and <i>Pneumora</i> are in nearly the same predicament.
</p>

<p>
Under the present head we may consider what may
perhaps be denominated without much impropriety <i>endemial</i>
groups; by which I mean those groups that are
regulated, as to their limits, not so much by the temperature,
or the northing and southing of the latitude, as by
the general aspect and circumstances of the country.
Thus, the vast and nearly insular continent of <i>Africa</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
almost as wide as it is long, and situated in or near the
tropics, instead of inland seas or sea-like rivers, is intersected
by parched sandy deserts, extending far and wide;
circumstances which, though in the vicinity of its streams
it is humid, impart an unusual degree of <i>aridity</i> as well
as heat to its general atmosphere; so that it well merits
the poet's epithet, <i>Leonum arida nutrix</i>; and is also peculiarly
fitted for all such animals, especially insects, as
delight in a dry, sandy, hot country, particularly such as
are predaceous in their habits. <i>America</i>, on the other
hand, exhibits quite an opposite character. It is long,
and comparatively narrow; surrounded, and almost divided
into two continents, by immense circumfluent
oceans; watered every where by rivers and lakes that
emulate seas: in some parts covered by interminable
forests; in others, intersected by ridges of the loftiest
mountains. These circumstances, except in its Llanos,
Pampas, or table-land, give a general character of humidity
to its atmosphere, and fit it particularly for the
production of a vast variety of peculiar plants, and for
the residence of numerous and peculiar phytiphagous
insects and other animals<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a>. Midway between these two
continents lies a third (for so the vast island of New
Holland may be denominated), which presents new features
in its general aspect, and consequently new forms
both in its <i>Flora</i> and <i>Fauna</i>, mixed with many old ones
parallel to those both of the new world and the old.
Perhaps Europe and Asia, with several that are peculiar,
agree more in their animal productions than the continents
just described.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
Let us next particularize a few of the peculiar types
that distinguish particular continents and countries. The
genera <i>Manticora</i>, <i>Graphipterus</i>, <i>Glaphyrus</i>, <i>Eurychora</i>,
<i>Pneumora</i>, <i>Masaris</i>, and many others, are peculiar to
Africa. In Asia alone we find <i>Mimela</i><a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a>, <i>Euchlora</i><a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a>,
<i>Colliuris</i>, <i>Catascopus</i><a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a>, <i>Apogonia</i><a name="FNanchor_1510_1510" id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a>, a peculiar type of
<i>Horia</i>, &amp;c. In America, <i>Agra</i>, <i>Galerita</i>, <i>Nilio</i>, another
type of <i>Horia</i>, <i>Tetraonyx</i>, <i>Rutela</i>, <i>Doryphora</i>, <i>Alurnus</i>,

<i>Castnia</i>, &amp;c. And in New Holland, <i>Helluo</i>, <i>Elephastomus</i>,
<i>Anoplognathus</i>, <i>Diphucephala</i><a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a>, <i>Cerapterus</i>,
<i>Heleus</i>, <i>Adelium</i>, <i>Notoclea</i>, <i>Achilus</i>, <i>Thynnus</i>, <i>Nycterobius</i>,
&amp;c.

The countries bordering upon the Mediterranean, the
Black, and the Caspian seas, agree in producing similar
insects. These countries, and the Cape of Good Hope
though so distant from them, appear to be the principal
seat of Heteromerous <i>Coleoptera</i>, of the genera <i>Lixus</i> and
<i>Brachycerus</i>, and of the conical <i>Buprestes</i><a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a>. But the insects
of Guiana, on one side the Cordilleras, differ from
those of New Granada and Peru on the other; and similar
differences are observed in other <i>neighbouring</i> countries
separated by natural boundaries.
</p>

<p>
iii. Another head connected with the topographical
distribution of insects relates to their <i>representation</i> of
each other. Here we may observe, that some insects represent
each other only in their <i>form</i>; others also in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
<i>function</i>; and others in <i>both</i>. I shall give some instances
of each. In Brazil there is a group of petalocerous
beetles (<i>Chasmodia</i>), one of the <i>Rutelidæ</i>, which in New
Holland has a representative, as to <i>form</i>, in one of the
<i>Cetoniadæ</i> (<i>Schizorhina</i><a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a>), which, having soft mandibles,
must have a different function:&mdash;it is to be observed,
however, that these insects appear to approach each other
in the series of affinities. Again, the <i>Carabidæ</i> may in
the same country be said to have a representative in the
remarkable heteromerous genus <i>Adelium</i><a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a>, which is altogether
an analogy. Others are representative only in
their <i>function</i>. The general function of insects is to remove
<i>nuisances</i> and to check <i>redundances</i>,&mdash;the saprophagous
tribes do the one, and the thalerophagous the
other. In going from the poles to the line,&mdash;in proportion
as the heat increases, the quantum of work of both
kinds increases; and new forms are either added to the
old ones, so as to increase their momentum; or new
ones, more powerfully talented, replace the old ones, and
act in their stead: thus we see a gradual and interesting
change take place in proportion as we approach the
maximum of heat and of insect population. At the Cape,
the <i>universal Cicindelæ</i> are aided by <i>Manticora</i>; in North
America, the <i>Silphidæ</i> by a new group, the type of which
is <i>Silpha Americana</i> (<i>Necrophila</i>, K.MS.); in South
America, <i>Copris</i> by <i>Phanæus</i>. Again: <i>Colliuris</i> and
<i>Drypta</i> of the <i>old</i> world, in the <i>new</i> give place to <i>Ctenostoma</i>
and <i>Agra</i>. The honey and wax of Europe, Asia,
and Africa, is prepared by <i>bees</i> congenerous with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
common hive-bee (<i>Apis</i>); while in America this genus
is not found as a native, but is replaced by <i>Melipona</i> and
<i>Trigona</i><a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a>; and in New Holland by a still different but
undescribed type. The <i>Melolonthidæ</i> and <i>Rutelidæ</i> of
the old and new world appear to have their work done
in that country by the brilliant and numerous <i>Anoplognathidæ</i>.
The <i>Rhipicera</i> of Brazil is of a different type
from that of New Holland. The singular genus <i>Cremastocheilus</i>
of North America has its representative in
Africa in <i>Genuchus</i><a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a>. The <i>Lucani</i> of the rest of the
world give place in New Holland to <i>Lamprima</i> and <i>Ryssonotus</i>.&mdash;I
could produce a much greater number of
examples, but these are sufficient to explain my meaning.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Having thus given you some, though an imperfect account,
of the <i>geographical</i> distribution of insects, I am
next to say something concerning their <i>local</i> distribution
in any district, or their favourite <i>haunts</i>; a knowledge
of which, with respect to those of our own country, is indispensable
to the collector.
</p>

<p>
The surface of a country consists either of mountains,
hills and valleys, or of plains. It is diversified by forest,
wood, or copse; and watered by rivers, rivulets, lakes,
and pools. Those parts that are not clothed with wood
are either open or inclosed, forming grassy downs, heaths,
pastures, meadows, morasses, and arable land. The soil
also is equally various:&mdash;we find clay, loam, marl, chalk,
vegetable mould, moor, sand, &amp;c. The mountains and
hills are either covered with a stratum of soil, or are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
rocky and bare; the arable lands are divided by living
or dead fences, the latter formed of various materials,&mdash;or
else they are open, and the property only marked
out by grassy balks, &amp;c. All these places abound in
shrubs and plants; some local, and some generally distributed.
But besides the <i>land</i> and its <i>fresh</i> waters, we
must look also to the <i>sea</i>, and its sandy, pebbly, or rocky
shores, and the sea-wrack that is cast up upon them; the
<i>estuaries</i> that receive its tides; the brackish waters and
saline marshes in its vicinity. All the above places, when
opportunity serves, the Entomologist should explore, for
in almost all he will find peculiar kinds of insects.
</p>

<p>
As <i>mountains</i> and <i>hills</i> have usually their own Flora,
the insects appropriated to alpine plants can only be met
with where the pabulum is found. Here also those northern
insects that are impatient of a warmer climate will
take their station, if they migrate to the southward<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a>.
The predaceous beetles likewise sometimes frequent a
mountainous district. <i>Carabus glabratus</i> was first taken
by Professor Hooker on Ingleborough; and probably,
if the Welsh and Scotch mountains were duly investigated
by an Entomologist, many novelties would reward
his toils. The <i>valleys</i> and <i>plains</i>, especially those of a
sunny exposition, abound in insects. When the heat of
the atmosphere indisposes you for motion, you will find
it no unprofitable or unpleasant employment, lying on
the grass, to search for minute beetles, which you will
there find coursing about amongst the tufts and roots of
the herbage. Thus you may procure many of the <i>Pselaphidæ</i>,
which you would not otherwise meet with. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
when the grass is grown up, insects are fond of alighting
upon its spikes, and thence drop or run to the ground.
Should circumstances ever carry you abroad to the
steppes or grassy plains of Tartary, or to Hungary, you
would find there two or three species of the singular genus
<i>Lethrus</i>, which burrows in the soil. Every hole is
inhabited by a male and female;&mdash;from it they issue to
attack the plants or vines; and having cut out the heart
of a plant, go backwards like a crab with the prize to
their burrow. At the time of pairing, sometimes violent
battles, encouraged by the female, take place between the
male and a stranger of that sex desirous of admission,
which cease only with the death or flight of the stranger<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a>.
The vicinity and borders of <i>woods</i> generally abound in
insects of every Order; and if you proceed, as hereafter
directed, will furnish you with numerous prizes, especially
of <i>Lepidoptera</i>. Here alone you can meet with the
purple emperor butterfly (<i>Apatura Iris</i>); and if properly
equipped you may readily secure him.
</p>

<p>
The <i>waters</i> you will find nearly as prolific in insects as
the land. In them, amongst the beetles, you may expect
to meet with <i>Dytiscus</i>, <i>Haliplus</i>, <i>Pælobius</i>, <i>Hyphydrus</i>,
<i>Hydroporus</i>, <i>Noterus</i>, <i>Colymbetes</i>, and other <i>Dytiscidæ</i>;
the <i>Gyrini</i>, <i>Hydrophili</i>, <i>Hydrænæ</i>, <i>Elophori</i>, &amp;c.: under
stones, the <i>Elmis</i>; and in the mud, the <i>Parni</i> and <i>Heteroceri</i>.
Some <i>Sphæridiadæ</i> are also aquatic: I have
taken more than once <i>Cercyon hæmorrhoidale</i> from the
under side of a piece of wood immersed in a canal<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a>.
Even a few of the weevil tribes are to be met with in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
water. <i>Lixus paraplecticus</i>, <i>Tanysphyrus Lemnæ</i>, <i>Bagous
atrirostris</i>, are of this description. A species of
<i>Ceutorhynchus</i> of Germar's <i>third</i> family (<i>C. Natator</i> K.)
<i>swims</i> well. On aquatic plants you must look for <i>Helodes</i>
and the splendid <i>Donaciæ</i>, which, living on submerged
shoots and roots of these plants in their larva
state, continue to attend them when perfect. Amongst
the <i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i><a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a>,&mdash;<i>Elaphrus</i>, <i>Notiophilus</i>, and <i>Bembidium</i>
frequent humid places, as the banks of rivers and
ponds; and in such a station, under the roots of <i>Potentilla
anserina</i>, <i>Polygonum</i>, &amp;c. if you should be fortunate
enough to find <i>Omophron limbatum</i>, which connects the
<i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i> with the <i>Eunech</i>in<i>a</i>, you will make a valuable
addition to the list of British insects. In the waters
also you will meet with many Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>;
as <i>Gerris</i>, <i>Hydrometra</i>, and <i>Velia</i>, and all the <i>Hydrocorisæ</i>
or water-bugs. On aquatic plants the larvæ of some <i>Lepidoptera</i>
feed, as <i>Hydrocampa stratiotata</i>, <i>potamogata</i>,
&amp;c. Those also of the <i>Trichoptera</i> must be sought for
in the water: and if you should feel inclined to see an
interesting collection of their very curious <i>cases</i>, Mr.
Sheppard of Wrabness can gratify your curiosity.
Though few or no <i>Hymenoptera</i> frequent this element,
vast numbers of <i>Diptera</i> are there alone to be met with
in their preparatory state, particularly the gnats. We
learn from Humboldt a curious fact with respect to those
of South America, or the <i>Zancudos</i>; that, with some exceptions,
these pests do not frequent those rivers called
by the natives <i>black waters</i>, but only those which they
name <i>white waters</i><a name="FNanchor_1522_1522" id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a>. Of the <i>Aptera</i>, the genera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
<i>Hydrachna</i>, <i>Eylaïs</i> and <i>Limnochares</i> are purely aquatic.
Several spiders will walk over the water; and one species
(<i>Argyroneta aquatica</i>) inhabits it<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a>. The <i>stagnant</i> waters
in your vicinity will produce different species from <i>running</i>
ones. Thus <i>Haliplus elevatus</i>, &amp;c. inhabits only the
<i>latter</i>, while the majority of the <i>Dytiscidæ</i> abound most
in the <i>former</i>: the more minute ones may be sought for
with success amongst the duckweed that covers a pool.
I do not recollect finding any insect in waters absolutely
<i>salt</i><a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a>; but <i>brackish</i> waters produce peculiar species: in
these only, <i>Hydræna marina</i> occurs; and many of those
large-eyed <i>Cimicidæ</i> (<i>Acanthia</i>), as <i>A. saltatoria</i>, <i>littoralis</i>,
and <i>Zosteræ</i> occur in places where salt water has been.
Latreille observes, that the genus <i>Pimelia</i> is to be met
with only where the soil is impregnated with saline particles,
or where the species of the genus <i>Salsola</i> abound<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heaths</i>, though they do not afford numerous insects,
have their rarities. <i>Cicindela sylvatica</i>, <i>Carabus nitens</i>
and <i>arvensis</i>, frequent them, and are not elsewhere to be
seen. <i>Curculio nebulosus</i> is also to be found on them, in
places where the turf has been peeled; and some scarce
<i>Lepidoptera</i>. In their vicinity, in sunny sandy banks,
some of the rarer <i>Ammophilæ</i> and <i>Pompili</i> may be taken;
and it is here only that I have ever met with <i>Panurgus</i><a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a>.
<i>Meadows</i> and <i>pastures</i> are not to be neglected. Early
in the year, when they are yellow with the blossoms of
<i>Ranunculus bulbosus</i>, <i>Leontodon Taraxacum</i>, &amp;c., many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
minute beetles, and not a few <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>,
frequent them. <i>Morasses</i> also have their peculiar insects.
In these you will meet with some of the scarcer <i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i>;
as <i>Chlænia holosericea</i> and <i>nigricornis</i>, <i>Blethisa
multipunctata</i>, various <i>Bembidia</i>, &amp;c. In this kind of district
in the Isle of Ely <i>Aphodius plagiatus</i> has been taken,
and that scarce and beautiful butterfly <i>Lycæna Virgaureæ</i>.
Where land is <i>cultivated</i> the Entomologist as
well as the farmer may expect a <i>harvest</i>. Insects in
general are fond of perching on the summit of a blade of
grass or corn; and many minute ones may be taken
coursing about in the ears of the latter: some to devour
the <i>fungilli</i> that infest the grain, as <i>Phalacrus corruscus</i>
in <i>Reticularia Segetum</i>; others to attack the grain itself,
as <i>Cecidomyia Tritici</i>; others to destroy these destroyers,
as three little parasites belonging to the <i>Chalcidites</i><a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a>.
But I have already mentioned most of those insects that
are to be expected in such situations<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a>: I shall therefore
only further observe, that upon <i>barley</i> particularly you
will meet with the species of Latreille's genus <i>Cephus</i>.
</p>

<p>
With respect to <i>soils</i>, those that are <i>light</i> appear to be
most prolific in insects. Warm <i>sandy</i> banks are frequented
by <i>Cicindela campestris</i>, <i>Opatrum sabulosum</i>, <i>Helops
quisquilius</i>, &amp;c.: in them (when of a southern aspect)
<i>Ammophilæ</i>, <i>Pompili</i>, and numerous <i>Hymenoptera</i> nidificate.
<i>Chalk</i> also attracts various insects. Latreille observes,
that the <i>Licini</i>, <i>Papilio Cleopatra</i>, several species
of <i>Dasytes</i>, and some <i>Lamiæ</i>, delight in this kind of soil<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a>:&mdash;in
my own neighbourhood I have observed <i>Polyommatus
Corydon</i> principally in chalk-pits. One of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
pits, under a wood in an adjoining parish, has produced
me several valuable insects. Here I took <i>Apion ebeninum</i>,
<i>Orobitis globosus</i>, a new species of <i>Evæsthetus</i>, several of
the rarer <i>Pselaphidæ</i> and <i>Cholevæ</i>, and <i>Chætophorus
cretifer</i> before noticed<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a>. I do not mean, however, that
all these are properly <i>chalk</i> insects; but they fall into
these pits, where they are readily discerned, from the
contrast of their colours with the whiteness of the chalk.
By watching attentively the bottom of one, vast numbers
in a warm day may be taken when they fall or are climbing
upwards. Of all soils <i>clay</i> offers the fewest inducements
to the Entomologist, who will lose both his time and
labour in a clay-pit; while in one of sand, chalk, or marl,
they will usually not be mispent. <i>Vegetable earth</i> also
affords a harbour to various larvæ, and the pupæ of
many nightfliers amongst the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, by digging in
it, especially under trees, may be obtained. Even the
bare <i>rocks</i> have their insect frequenters that take shelter
in their fissures; and in the early part of your career
especially you should always turn over large stones, as
beneath them many of the <i>Harpalidæ</i> and other <i>Eutrech</i>in<i>a</i>
frequently lie hid: and in this situation, both in
Suffolk and Sussex, <i>Lomechusa emarginata</i>, one of our
scarcest <i>Brachyptera</i>, has been taken. Old trees also,
and planks that have laid long without being moved,
often afford a shelter to many of the minute <i>Coleoptera</i>;
as <i>Pselaphidæ</i>, <i>Aleocharidæ</i>, <i>Cryptophagidæ</i>, <i>Scymnidæ</i>,
&amp;c. <i>Live</i> fences, especially when the hawthorn is in
blossom, and where trees are also intermixed, are attended
by innumerable insects of almost every description;
and even the black-thorn will present you with one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
our most splendid weevils (<i>Rhynchites Bacchus</i>). <i>Dead</i>
fences are almost as fertile in insects as living ones. In
<i>gates</i>, <i>posts</i>, <i>rails</i>, and other <i>timber</i> when felled, the
timber-devouring tribes take their station:&mdash;between the
bark and the wood are the <i>Bostrichidæ</i>; in the wood
itself, the <i>Anobidæ</i> and the Capricorn beetles. Here
also you may meet with many <i>Hymenoptera</i>, which
either devour timber or nidificate in it,&mdash;as the <i>Siricidæ</i>,
<i>Chelostoma</i>, <i>Trypoxylon</i>, <i>Sapyga</i>, and several <i>Diptera</i>.
In the decaying hedgestakes and sticks, where the
<i>Sphæria decorticans</i> has turned off the bark, you may
meet with <i>Anthribus brevirostris</i>; with <i>A. latirostris</i>, and
other beetles, in <i>S. fraxinea</i>; and <i>A. albinus</i>, which I
have more than once captured as it was emerging from
the fissure of a gate-post, probably feeds on some internal
fungus. The grassy <i>balks</i> that separate open
fields usually abound in umbelliferous plants, which are
attended by numerous <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>, particularly
by the various species of the splendid tribe of
<i>Chrysidæ</i>: and the grassy banks of fences, where the
aspect is sunny, are generally bored by a variety of insects
of the former Order, to prepare a nest for their
young. <i>Andrenidæ</i> and <i>Nomadidæ</i> particularly select
this situation, the latter probably depositing their eggs
in the burrows of the former<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a>. By watching these places
in the spring, you may perhaps have the good fortune
to meet with a <i>Stylops</i>. It is singular, that some insects
choose, for their own residence or that of their young,
the hardest and most trodden pathways. Thus, some
ants will build their subterranean apartments under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
gravel walks; and so do many species of the genus
<i>Halictus</i><a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a>, the habits and economy of which have been
so ably detailed by M. Walckenaër<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a>: <i>Cerceris</i> also, and
other <i>Hymenoptera</i>, will choose such places, however
public, for the site of their nests or burrows. The ground
is so consolidated by the constant foot, that they, probably
find such situations spare them a world of labour, and
therefore in their choice balance one inconvenience by
another.
</p>

<p>
Though the <i>sea</i> itself, I believe, produces no true <i>insects</i>,
yet there are many that constantly or occasionally
haunt its shores. On the sand-hills of the Norfolk coast
I found <i>Ægialia globosa</i> and <i>Cicindela hybrida</i>. <i>Ceutorhynchus
horridus</i> inhabits thistles that grow near the sea.
Under the <i>Zostera</i> and <i>Fuci</i>, (cast up both on its beach
and the shores of estuaries,) many peculiar species of
<i>Cercyon</i>, several <i>Aphodii</i>, and numerous <i>Brachyptera</i>,
may often be found. In this situation the rare and
singular <i>Bledius armatus</i> has been taken. At certain
seasons of the year the beach and environs of the sea are
covered by many species of <i>Coccinella</i>, which seem to
bend their course thither from the inland country, as if
they were about to emigrate<a name="FNanchor_1534_1534" id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a>. When the weather is
fine and the tide begins to retire, at the line of its
highest rise I have taken on the eastern coast a variety
of insects, and amongst the rest <i>Anomala Frischii</i>. The
inundations of rivers, except in the depth of winter,
always bring a number of these little creatures, which
float on the surface on bits of stick, weeds, &amp;c.; and
where they deposit these articles when the water begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
to subside, you may generally reap a plentiful harvest of
various kinds.
</p>

<p>
You see, now, how varied is the scenery to which the
diversion of the Entomologist introduces him; that he
is never out of his way: whether on hill or in valley; on
upland or plain; on the heath or in the forest; on the
land or on the water; in the heart of a country or on
its shores;&mdash;still his game is within his reach. But in
order to enable him to pursue it with greater prospect of
success, he must recollect that not only is every face of
the country to be explored, but both the <i>plants</i> and the
<i>animals</i> that it produces; and that he must not turn with
disgust from even the <i>carcase</i> or the <i>excrement</i> of the
latter. As numerous species of herbivorous insects feed
only on <i>one</i> kind of plant, the Entomologist, when he
discovers a scarce one, should examine it with the hope
of finding upon it a scarce insect. Sometimes it happens
that only a single opportunity occurs in a man's life of
seeing certain plants growing wild: such opportunities
should never be neglected. Some insects also inhabit a
plant in one district or season, and not in another. Thus
the most beautiful of the Apions, <i>A. Limonii</i><a name="FNanchor_1535_1535" id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a>, though the
plant it feeds upon usually abounds near the sea, I have
discovered only on the northern coast of Norfolk; and another
scarcely less beautiful, but more minute (<i>A. Astragali</i><a name="FNanchor_1536_1536" id="FNanchor_1536_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a>),
though I have sought for it year after year, <i>Astragalus
glyciphyllus</i> being abundant near me, I never
found but once. The blossoms of plants as well as the
leaves must be inspected. In those of the rose, the <i>Cetonia
aurata</i> is often taken<a name="FNanchor_1537_1537" id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a>; and in the bells of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
different species of <i>Campanula</i> various bees may be captured
enjoying a luxurious repose<a name="FNanchor_1538_1538" id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a>. No vegetable productions
abound more in insect inhabitants than the
<i>Fungi</i>. In Agarics several <i>Diptera</i> are to be taken, many
<i>Aleocharæ</i>, <i>Oxypori</i>, &amp;c.; in Boleti, the various species of
<i>Mycetophagus</i>; in the arboreous ones, and under bark,
more than one kind of <i>Ips</i>; and in <i>Auricularia</i>, as well
as <i>Boletus</i>, the whole genus <i>Cis</i>. Upon <i>living</i> Vertebrate
animals you must look for <i>Pulices</i>, <i>Pediculi</i>, <i>Nirmi</i>, <i>Acari</i>,
and many <i>Diptera</i>, as <i>&#338;strus</i>, <i>Tabanus</i>, <i>Stomoxys</i>, and
the <i>Pupipara</i> of Latreille; and on the garden-snails for
that curious genus <i>Drilus</i>, and some <i>Acari</i><a name="FNanchor_1539_1539" id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a>. The
caterpillars and pupæ of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, &amp;c. will, as you
have heard, furnish you with numerous ichneumons<a name="FNanchor_1540_1540" id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a>.
On <i>dead</i> animals you will find the various species of <i>Silphidæ</i>,
<i>Nitidulidæ</i>, <i>Dermestidæ</i>, <i>Byrrhidæ</i>, <i>Chlolevidæ</i>,
<i>Staphilinidæ</i>, <i>Muscidæ</i>, &amp;c.; and in excrement, various
<i>Scarabæidæ</i>, <i>Histeridæ</i>, <i>Aphodiadæ</i>, <i>Sphæridiadæ</i>, the
<i>Brachyptera</i> in general, and several <i>Diptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1541_1541" id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a>. In putrescent
roots and fruits, as the turnip, the cucumber, &amp;c.,
you may also occasionally meet with rare <i>Coleoptera</i>.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
I must next say something upon the <i>seasons</i> of insects,
and their times of appearance. Those that collect honey
and pollen are generally among the first that proclaim
the approach of spring; and their appearance may be
dated from the blossoming of certain trees and plants of
common occurrence. Other plants, accompanied by peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
insects, blossom later; and so on till we arrive at
the autumn. The <i>earliest</i> insect-season commences with
the flowering of the <i>sallow</i> (<i>Salix Caprea</i>) usually accompanied
in the garden by that of the <i>crocus</i> and the
<i>gooseberry</i>. Then is your time to collect many species of
wild bees and <i>Diptera</i> not afterwards to be met with:
and various other insects now begin to emerge from their
winter-quarters, or are produced from the pupa. <i>Another</i>
and later season is marked by the general blossoming
of the butter-cup (<i>Ranunculus bulbosus</i>), accompanied
by the marsh-marygold (<i>Caltha palustris</i>) and ladies'-smock
(<i>Cardamine pratensis</i>); when you may hunt the
pastures, meadows, and marshes with success, and take
some insects that do not show themselves later. The coprophagous
insects are now abundant. Amongst others,
<i>Aphodius testudinarius</i>, a perfectly <i>vernal</i> species, is now
only to be taken, and usually flying. A <i>third</i> insect-season
indicated by Flora, and a very prolific one, commences
with the blossoming of the <i>hawthorn</i>, when you
must desert the meads for the inclosures. At this time
all nature begins to put on her gayest attire, and all her
insect tribes are now on the alert, and fill the air. They
are almost universally attracted by the sweet and lovely
blossoms of the plant just named: so that by examining
them you may entrap some of every Order, and many
that during the year will appear no more. Even many
of the saprophagous insects will sip nectar from these
flowers. The <i>umbelliferous</i> plants proclaim the <i>fourth</i>
season of insects, particularly the wild <i>carrot</i> and <i>parsnip</i>.
You will scarcely ever fail to find, if the weather is genial,
<i>Hymenopterous</i> and <i>Dipterous</i> insects of various genera,&mdash;especially
such as have a <i>short</i> tongue,&mdash;engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
in collecting the honey from those plants. Here you
may take some of the rarer <i>Chrysidæ</i>, <i>Crabronidæ</i>, <i>Cercerides</i>,
&amp;c., and occasionally even <i>Coleoptera</i>. The <i>last</i>
insect-season may be dated from the general flowering
of the <i>thistle</i> tribe. When these are in blossom is the
best time of all to collect the <i>humble-bees</i> (<i>Bombus</i><a name="FNanchor_1542_1542" id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a>), the
leaf-cutter bees (<i>Megachile</i><a name="FNanchor_1543_1543" id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a>), and many other <i>Apiariæ</i>,
which alone by their long tongues can imbibe the honey
and collect the pollen of these flowers. The male humble-bees
frequent them to the last, and often seem as if
they were intoxicated with their sweets.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps you may prefer considering the whole
summer appearance of insects as divided into <i>three</i> principal
seasons. This may thus be done. Their <i>vernal</i>
season may commence <i>Florente Caprea</i>, and end <i>Florente
Oxyacantha</i>; their <i>summer</i>, <i>Florente Oxyacantha</i> and <i>Florentibus
Umbellatis</i>; their <i>autumn</i>, <i>Florentibus Umbellatis</i>
and <i>Florente Carduo</i>. In the <i>first</i>, the number of insects
will be daily <i>increasing</i>; in the <i>second</i> (which is the harvest
of the Entomologist, when his eyes and his hands
ought to be every where), they will reach their <i>utmost
complement</i>; and in the <i>third</i>, they will be gradually decreasing
in number, till they generally die, or go into
winter-quarters. At this time many minute <i>Diptera</i> and
Ichneumons take shelter from the weather in the windows
of our apartments. These seasons will not always exactly
correspond with our usual reckoning, and take place at
the same time; since, being regulated by our varying temperature,
they will be sometimes sooner and sometimes
later, sometimes longer and sometimes shorter. Though
I have not named a <i>brumal</i> season, because insects are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
winter usually torpid,&mdash;yet some, as <i>Diurnea Novembris</i>,
<i>Cheimatobia brumata</i>, and many <i>Tipulariæ</i>, even then
make their appearance.
</p>

<p>
If you ask, Whether it be not possible to regulate our
Entomological seasons by the appearance of insects themselves?
I should answer, that probably this might be
done; but that further observations seem wanted to enable
us to do it satisfactorily. Perhaps the appearance
of <i>Formica rufa</i> beginning the business of the year might
form the commencement of one season; the flight of the
orange-tip butterfly (<i>Pontia Cardamines</i><a name="FNanchor_1544_1544" id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a>), of a second;
a third might be indicated by the swarming of <i>Melolontha
vulgaris</i>; a fourth, by that of <i>Amphimalla solstitialis</i>; and
the last, by the appearance in numbers of <i>Aphodius ciliaris</i>,
which in the autumn fills every horse-dropping.
</p>

<p>
Some insects are so ephemeral, that they are to be
found in numbers only for a few days, and then disappear
for that season. Of this description are the <i>Ephemeræ</i>,
much of whose history has been detailed to you.
Those of which De Geer has given an account (<i>E. vulgata</i>)
appeared about the end of May or the beginning
of June, and continued about a <i>fortnight</i><a name="FNanchor_1545_1545" id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a>; while those
which Swammerdam observed did not come forth till
the middle of June, and lasted only <i>three</i> days<a name="FNanchor_1546_1546" id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a>. The
<i>same</i> period distinguished those of which Reaumur has
compiled so interesting a history, but they did not show
themselves before the middle of August<a name="FNanchor_1547_1547" id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a>. My kind
friend Mr. Marsham not long before his death copied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
for me some memoranda he had made with respect to
the sudden appearance of <i>Cercopis bifasciata</i>. On one
occasion the white dress of a lady sitting upon a haycock
was covered by these insects; but on the following
day the same steps were taken at the same time to procure
some, when after the most diligent search not a
single one could be found. The same circumstance was
observed a few years afterwards by another friend of his.
He himself was of opinion that the insects in question
were then migrating<a name="FNanchor_1548_1548" id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a>.
</p>

<p>
I may here observe, that the London amateurs have
particular <i>seasons</i> for collecting <i>moths</i>. For the <i>imago</i>
they go into the woods in <i>April</i>, <i>May</i>, <i>June</i>, and <i>October</i>.
For the <i>larvæ</i> they take the beginning of <i>April</i>,
<i>June</i>, the beginning of <i>July</i>, and <i>September</i>. They dig
for <i>pupæ</i> late in <i>July</i>, and in <i>January</i> and <i>February</i>.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
I shall lastly make a few observations upon the <i>times</i>
of <i>action</i> and <i>repose</i> of insects, the knowledge of which,
as far as it can be obtained, is of essential use to the industrious
collector. Entomologists have divided the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
with a view to this circumstance, into <i>diurnal</i>,
<i>crepuscular</i>, and <i>nocturnal</i>; or butterflies (<i>Papilio</i> L.),
hawkmoths (<i>Sphinx</i> L.), and moths (<i>Phalæna</i> L.). These
terms may be applied to insects in general.
</p>

<p>
i. <i>Diurnal</i> insects are abundant. <i>Butterflies</i> in particular
fly generally at no other time: they accompany the
sun in his course, and before he sets disappear. Some
other <i>Lepidoptera</i>, though not so named, are <i>day</i> insects:&mdash;such
are the <i>Zygænidæ</i>, &amp;c. amongst the hawkmoths;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
and amongst the moths, <i>Plusia Gamma</i>, the <i>Phytometræ
solares</i> of Haworth<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a>, and some others. Numberless <i>Coleoptera</i>
belong to this section. The <i>Donaciæ</i> fly only
when the sun is out and the air is warm; they are then
extremely agile and difficult to take. Some <i>Hopliæ</i>
swarm in the day before noon, and then disappear<a name="FNanchor_1550_1550" id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a>:
most of the <i>tetramerous</i> beetles also appear to be diurnal.
The <i>Libellulina</i> and many other <i>Neuroptera</i> may
also be so termed; and the <i>Hymenoptera</i> almost universally,
with the sole exception of the <i>Formicidæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1551_1551" id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a>.
Amongst the <i>Diptera</i>, if we leave out the <i>Tipulariæ</i>, the
rest will be found for the most part to belong to the present
section.
</p>

<p>
ii. <i>Crepuscular</i> insects, strictly speaking, are those that
appear only during the twilight, whether in the morning
or evening; but the term may be understood, with some
latitude, to signify all those insects that are seen only in
the morning and evening, though after sunrise and before
sunset. Of these, some come forth only in the <i>morning</i>,
others only in the <i>evening</i>, and others both <i>morning</i> and
<i>evening</i>. My memory only furnishes me with a single
instance of an insect whose principal appearance and
flight are in the <i>morning</i>. <i>Catocala nupta</i> I have often
seen flying at this time, about six or seven o'clock, and
never at any other: I am not however prepared to assert
that it does not appear in the evening or night, but I
have then never met with it. In the <i>evening</i> more particularly
you hear the hum of the dung-beetle (<i>Geotrupes</i>),
which Linné thought the prognostic of a following
fine day; and of the swarms of <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
and <i>Amphimalla solstitialis</i>. Then also many other
<i>Coleoptera</i> are in the air; especially before a thunderstorm,
a state of the atmosphere that particularly excites
insects<a name="FNanchor_1552_1552" id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a>: <i>Ptinus imperialis</i> and <i>germanus</i> I have never
taken except under these circumstances. Then the
<i>Ephemeræ</i> sport in the air, and lead their mystic dance.
The majority of the hawkmoths are then too on the
wing, with their long tongues imbibing the nectar of
the flowers while they hover over them, both <i>morning</i>
and <i>evening</i>.
</p>

<p>
iii. In the <i>night</i> the main body of the <i>moths</i> take their
flight, as well as a vast number of <i>Coleoptera</i> and insects
of other orders. At this time the <i>Blattæ</i> and
crickets leave their hiding-places and run about: but
the other <i>Grylli</i> L., though they sing in the night, fly
only in the day. Then also the <i>Carabi</i>, like beasts of
prey, leave their dark retreats,&mdash;in this differing from
the <i>Cicindelæ</i>, which are diurnal,&mdash;and prowl about to
entrap other unwary insects. Then, likewise, the female
glowworm hangs out her lamp of love, and the male,
led by it, wings his way to her: and then the water-beetles
(<i>Dytisci</i>, <i>Gyrini</i>, &amp;c.) forsake the waves and become
tenants of the air.
</p>

<p>
Could we with certainty discover the stations in which
insects after their excursions take their <i>repose</i>, we might
capture many that we now search for in vain. Several
of these stations were pointed out in a former part of this
letter where I detailed their usual <i>haunts</i>. I may here
add, that numbers of them, when reposing, conceal themselves
from their enemies on the under side of the leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
of trees and plants. Moths, especially the <i>Noctuidæ</i>,
may often be met with in woods, as before observed<a name="FNanchor_1553_1553" id="FNanchor_1553_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a>,
on the <i>north</i> side of the trunks of trees. Mr. Marsham
related to me, that once a little before sunset, observing
over his head a number of insects on the wing moving
on in one direction, he caught some of them, and they
proved to be <i>Labia minor</i>. Struck with the circumstance,
he watched them several evenings; and on one,
as he was looking about a melon-pit for insects, he saw
these little animals alight on the frame, hastily fold up
their wings, and entering under the glasses, run down
its sides and bury themselves in the loose earth. This
he observed repeatedly. The onward flight of these insects
was therefore evidently their return from their
diurnal cruise to their nocturnal station.&mdash;This happened
in September.

<h2><a name="LETTER_L" id="LETTER_L">LETTER L</a>.</h2>

<h3><i>ON ENTOMOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS; AND
THE BEST METHODS OF COLLECTING,
BREEDING, AND PRESERVING INSECTS.</i></h3>

<p>
Having in my last letter given you some account of
the <i>haunts</i> of insects, I now proceed to describe the various
<i>instruments</i> with which you ought to be provided,
to enable you to collect them; and the best mode of employing
each. The Entomologist when he makes an
excursion should have <i>three</i> principal objects in view,
for which he ought to be duly prepared. The first is to
<i>find</i> insects, the next is to <i>catch</i> them, and the last when
taken to bring them <i>safe</i> home. In exploring their
haunts he must also recollect that some will be <i>reposing</i>;
others <i>feeding</i>; others <i>walking</i> or <i>running</i>; others <i>flying</i>;
others <i>swimming</i>; others <i>lurking</i> in various places
of concealment, and in <i>different</i> states of existence; and
that he must be prepared with means of coming at and
capturing them under all these circumstances.
</p>

<p>
1. First furnish yourself with a strong <i>knife</i> or other instrument
with which you can raise the bark or penetrate
the wood of any tree, when circumstances indicate that insects
are busy below the one or within the other. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
is no better tool for this and other purposes than Mr.
Samouelle's <i>digger</i>, which consists of an iron five inches
long, rather more than one-third of an inch in diameter,
forming a curve towards the extremity, terminating in a
lozenge-shaped point, and strongly fixed in a wooden
handle<a name="FNanchor_1554_1554" id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a>. With this you may not only explore the interior
of timber-trees, but grub up the turf under them,
and examine the earth for the pupæ of <i>Lepidoptera</i>.
When your object is merely this <i>latter</i> purpose, a potato-fork&mdash;which
is better than a spade, as it will seldom
injure the pupæ&mdash;will be your best implement.
</p>

<p>
2. Next have a <i>stick</i>, to resemble a common walking-stick,
sufficiently stout to beat the branches of the trees
and shrubs, fitted at one end with a male screw, and at
the other with a female, with a brass cap to screw over
each to keep the dirt from them. Besides this, you may
carry with you a spare piece or two about a foot long,
properly equipped to screw to it when you want to
lengthen it.
</p>

<p>
3. Another implement must be a <i>bag-net</i><a name="FNanchor_1555_1555" id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a>. This consists
of a hoop of stout brass wire about nine inches or
a foot in diameter, with a socket to receive the end of
your stick, or, what is more secure, a screw to fix it to it,
with a bag of gauze, muslin, or fine canvass, about twelve
inches deep, sewed round it. The French collectors
use a net of this kind, in which the hoop is formed of
two semicircular pieces of iron or brass wire hooked together
at one end, and at the other made to lap over the
corresponding piece, and pierced to receive the screw at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
one end of your stick. When not employed, they double
the hoop and conceal it under the vest; they fix to it a
muslin bag of two feet long. This net is made to serve
various purposes. With it they catch <i>Lepidoptera</i> and
other <i>flying</i> insects; and an adroit collector by giving it a
certain twist completely closes the mouth, so as to prevent
the escape of his captives. Fixed to a very long pole
(Mr. Haworth says it should be <i>twenty</i> or <i>thirty</i> feet
long<a name="FNanchor_1556_1556" id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a>), it is the best net for the purple emperor butterfly
(<i>Apatura Iris</i>). It is also used with success to <i>push</i> before
you through the <i>grass</i> of meadows, woods, &amp;c., and
thus often displaces numerous insects, which fall into it;&mdash;every
now and then it is examined, and the valuable
captures secured. The common bag-net will perform
the same operations, but is not deep enough for <i>flying</i>
insects. If you lengthen your stick before you screw it
on, it enables you to brush with it the weeds at the sides
and bottom of ditches. This employment of brushing
the grass, &amp;c. may be carried on if you are walking with
any friend not interested in Entomology, without much
interruption of conversation. For this last operation&mdash;sweeping
the grass, &amp;c.&mdash;if you wish at any time to devote
a morning wholly to it, you will find a net invented
by the late Mr. Paul, of Starston in Norfolk, and which
he employs to clear his turnips of <i>Haltica Nemorum</i><a name="FNanchor_1557_1557" id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a>, a
very useful implement. The accompanying figure will
give you a better idea of it than any description<a name="FNanchor_1558_1558" id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a>; you
may make it large or small according to your convenience:
the wider it is, the greater space it will brush at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
once. When your object is a more general investigation,
the bag-net just described is preferable.
</p>

<p>
4. Scarcely any implement seems a greater favourite
with British collectors than what may be called the <i>fly-net</i><a name="FNanchor_1559_1559" id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a>.
This is universally employed by them for capturing
<i>flying</i> insects, especially <i>Lepidoptera</i>. It is similar
to what is called a <i>bat-fowling</i> net, and should be
made of green or white gauze or coarse muslin. The
<i>former</i> colour, as being less visible, is most proper for
<i>mothing</i> in the <i>night</i>; but the <i>latter</i> is best for the <i>day</i>,
as this net is useful to hold under the branches of trees
and shrubs to receive the insects that fall when they are
beaten. The rods for the net we are considering,&mdash;which
should be about five feet long, half an inch in diameter
at the base, and gradually tapering to the end,&mdash;must be
made of some tough wood; each should consist of about
four joints for the convenience of carriage, and each
joint should be fitted with a socket at the lower extremity,
to receive the top of the joint below it: the terminal
joint must either be bent into a curve, or fitted
with an angular socket or ferrule, so as to form an obtuse
angle with the rest of the rod<a name="FNanchor_1560_1560" id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a>. The gauze which is
to form the net, being cut into the requisite shape, should
be welted round, except at the bottom, where it should
have a deep fold or a bag for preventing the escape of
the included insects&mdash;in order to form a slide for the
rods to slip in. At the apex where they meet, a few
stitches should be set, or a piece of leather sewed in, to
prevent their going too far. At the bottom, on each
side, two strings must be sewed on the net, to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
which there must be a hole in each rod about six inches
from the bottom: these must be tied, which will keep the
net from slipping upwards. When you go after moths
and other insects that fly in the <i>night</i>, a plan, as I am
told, of some of the London collectors may be adopted
with advantage. Cause a lanthorn to be made with a
concave back, and furnished with a reflector: this must
be fastened, by means of a strap, upon the stomach. If
you hold your expanded fly-net before this (as nocturnal
insects fly to the light), you may thus entrap a considerable
number. In sultry summer nights also, if you place a
candle on a table in a summer-house, or even in a common
apartment, and open the windows, you will often
have excellent sport, and take insects you might otherwise
never meet with.
</p>

<p>
When you use your fly-net, you must take the rods
one in each hand, so as to keep it extended; and when
you have brought it fairly beyond the insect you are pursuing,&mdash;to
accomplish which you must be upon the alert,&mdash;you
must bring the two sticks together, which, if you
are commonly dexterous, will capture your prey. This
net is likewise useful in taking winged insects when at
rest upon the ground, by simply spreading it over them.
When you use it to beat into, as above recommended,
you must take both the sticks in one hand, and extend
it by crossing them as much as you can. In the
absence of this, a common umbrella, or even a sheet of
stiff paper which you may carry folded in your pocket,
are no bad substitutes. When your object is <i>beating
the bushes</i>, bring your fly-net, &amp;c. rapidly under the
branches you mean to operate upon, or the insects will
fall from them to the ground before you are prepared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Under this head I may mention a very ingenious net
for taking <i>Lepidoptera</i>, particularly <i>butterflies</i>, invented
by Dr. Maclean of Colchester, which I would call <i>Maclean's
elastic net</i>. It is constructed of two pieces of
stout, split cane, connected by a joint at each end and
with a rod which lies between them, in which a pulley is
fixed; through this a cord fastened to the canes passes;
a long cane with a ferrule receives the lower end of the
rod and forms a handle; and to the canes is fastened a
net of green gauze. Taking the handle in your right
hand, and the string in your left, when you pull the latter
the canes bend till they form a hoop, and the net
appended to them is open; when your prey is in it, relax
the cord, and the canes become straight and close the
mouth of the net, keeping them close with your left hand,
you may soon disable your prey with your right. Dr.
Maclean has scarcely ever found this net fail.
</p>

<p>
5. Another instrument which should be constantly in
the hands of the Entomologist is the <i>forceps</i><a name="FNanchor_1561_1561" id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a>. This is
particularly useful for catching <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Hymenoptera</i>
chiefly while at rest on the leaves and flowers of
plants. Both these tribes are usually too agile to be
taken by the hand alone, which besides without this
contrivance would be exposed to the stings of many of
the latter. The leaves of the forceps should be <i>octagonal</i>,
five or six inches in diameter, and covered with green
gauze, or rather very fine catgut, which will enable the
head of a lace-pin to pass through it. You must direct
your artisan to make the joint of the handle nearer the
rings for the finger and thumb than to the leaves, or the
instrument will not open well. An old pair of curling-irons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
might be made into very good handles; but the hoop
to which the catgut is fastened should be brass, or if iron
it ought to be painted to secure it from rust. Some make
the leaves of the forceps <i>round</i>; but when an insect is
perched on a wall or any <i>vertical</i> surface, it has less chance
of escape if you can apply a straight side to its station.
The Germans use a much longer and larger instrument
of this kind, having leaves of ten or twelve inches in diameter,
which they use to catch <i>Lepidoptera</i> when settled
on plants. When you aim at an insect with your forceps,
you must expand the leaves as much as possible,
and cautiously approach your prey; and when within
reach, close them upon it suddenly, including the leaf or
flower on which it rests. As these are sometimes bulky,
and prevent the instrument from shutting closely,&mdash;that
the included insect may not escape, it is often necessary
to use the other hand to bring them together, when the
pressure of the finger and thumb soon disables it.
</p>

<p>
6. As the <i>waters</i>, whether running or stagnant, as well
as the earth and the air, teem with insects, you must
likewise be provided with a net of a different description
from any of the preceding, that you may <i>fish</i> them out.
It may be made of fine canvass, just deep enough to prevent
the insect from jumping out, and fastened to a brass
hoop five or six inches in diameter, not perfectly circular,
but having the segment of a circle cut off anteriorly,
so that it will apply well to a flat vertical surface; and
fitted posteriorly with a socket, to receive the end of
your stick; or, what is better, with a <i>screw</i>, which will
securely fasten it to it<a name="FNanchor_1562_1562" id="FNanchor_1562_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a>. In using this net, different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
modes may be adopted. You may either watch the motions
of an individual insect, and secure it by darting
the net beyond it and drawing it towards you; or by
placing it quietly under it, and then elevating it suddenly;
or you may push your net at random along the margins
of the pools and rivers amongst the weeds, &amp;c.; amongst
the duck-weed (<i>Lemna</i>) on their surface, or the mud at
the bottom; and when you examine its contents, you
will often find valuable captures. I have thus sometimes
got rich booty in the most unlikely places;&mdash;such as
<i>Hydræna longipalpis</i>, and an allied nondescript species,
&amp;c.; and by fishing amongst <i>Zanichellia palustris</i>, <i>Hæmonia
Zosteræ</i>. If at any time you do not happen to
have your water-net with you, with a common rake you
may take the duck-weed from the surface of a pool, and
upon examination you will often detect amongst it many
minute water-beetles.
</p>

<p>
But besides all these implements you will find your
<i>finger</i> and <i>thumb</i> a very <i>handy</i> forceps when insects are
stationary or walking upon the ground; and even when
flying, minute ones that you would not otherwise meet
with may be taken by the palm of your hand, wetted
with saliva, if, when you see them swarming in the air,
you pass it to and fro amongst them. When such are
stationary, or moving on the ground, on rails, the trunks
of trees, &amp;c., the fore-finger, so wetted, will often best
secure them: but if they are perched on a summit or a
vertical surface, before you approach near enough to
alarm them bring forward quietly your bag-net, and
hold it so that they may fall into it, if they attempt by
falling to escape you. Other methods of entrapping insects
may also be pursued with success. A table-cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
spread on the grass in the open parts of a wood I have
known allure several scarce insects: a lady's white dress
is equally attractive. An old mattress, laid at night upon
a grass-plat, if suddenly reversed in the morning, will
supply the Entomologist occasionally with good <i>Coleoptera</i>.
No better trap for the <i>Silphidæ</i>, <i>Dermestidæ</i>,
&amp;c., than a piece of carrion, a frog, or mole, &amp;c. The
numerous insects that inhabit excrement of every kind,
especially that of the cow and the horse, may be best
taken by immersing their pabulum in water: for this
purpose, let a boy carry a spade and pail to the scene of
action, and filling the pail nearly full of water begin the
operation, and all the insects lurking in the submerged
dung will come to the surface, and may be easily taken.
</p>

<p>
Another object of the collector of insects, when he has
once entrapped them, is to bring them <i>safe</i> home. The
Entomologists on the Continent, I believe, generally
transfix their prey, of whatever Order, with a pin, as
soon as they are caught: but as <i>hard</i> ones, such as <i>Coleoptera</i>,
<i>Hemiptera</i>, &amp;c., may be destroyed without injury
by immersion either in spirits of wine or boiling
water; and as large beetles, if transfixed (not to mention
the unnecessary cruelty of so serving them), are apt to
whirl round upon the pin in spite of any precaution, and
injure themselves, and destroy other insects that are in
their way, it seems best to kill them by other more effectual
methods. With regard to those that would be
injured by immersion in any fluid, as the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
<i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c., they must be secured as
soon as taken; and after having disabled them as much
as you can without injuring them, by pressing the trunk
below the wings with the finger and thumb, they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
be transfixed and put into a pocket-box lined with cork.
Some use an oblong deep chip one, with paper pasted
over it, and lined at top and bottom, the top being convenient
for setting small moths. But this you will find
not easy to open when you have an insect in one hand;
and it is too deep for the pocket. I generally use a
mahogany one, about 7&frac12; inches by 4&frac12; and 1&frac14; deep in
the clear, corked only at the bottom, and opening by
pressing a spring, which can be done with one hand.
This will contain as many of the above insects as you
will usually take in a day's excursion. When travelling,
you should provide yourself with larger store-boxes, to
receive at night the fruit of the day's hunt. These may
be 18 inches square and 2&frac12; deep, corked at top and bottom;
which should be of equal depth, and fit very closely,
to keep out <i>Acari</i>, &amp;c. Entomologists have recourse
to various ways of bringing home insects for immersion.
For the larger ones, you must be provided with a number
of small boxes, the lids of which are not liable to
come off in the pocket. If it can be done, it is best to
have only a single insect in a box. If you have several,
those that are predaceous in their habits will probably
devour the rest: and besides, if you open a box to put
in other insects, generally one or two of those before
imprisoned in it will make their escape. It is best to put
the boxes containing an insect in one pocket, and the
empty ones in another. If your boxes are numbered, in
a small memorandum-book, which you should carry for
the purpose, you may make any remarks as to the food,
station, and habits of any insect you may take, inserting
against them the number of the box or phial that contains
it, and it will be ready for future use. For the smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
beetles, &amp;c. a number of phials, with their rims ground
down and the mouths well fitted with corks, must be provided;
but for those you do not wish to keep separate,
a wide-mouthed phial filled with spirits of wine, which
soon kills them, is the best receptacle. I have found,
when at a loss, a piece of elder, with the pith taken out
to a sufficient depth at each end and each mouth stopped
with a wooden plug, a useful insect box. As numerous
insects inhabit the various species of <i>Boleti</i>, if you go
where these are to be found, unless you are a very agile
person and expert at climbing, a boy with a short light
ladder will be no useless accompaniment.
</p>

<p>
Something may be said in this place upon the <i>dress</i>
with which the Entomologist should provide himself. I
shall not recommend to you, in imitation of the insect-hunters
in the vignette to Reaumur's second volume, to
put on a bag-wig and a velvet court-dress; but the plain
fustian jacket with side and other pockets used by English
sportsmen will very well suit your purpose; only
let the pockets be sufficiently ample: have also an inside
one fixed on the left-hand side to receive your forceps.
You may also have a bag like a shooter's, or an angler's
basket, which may contain your nets till you want to use
them. With all your implements about you, you will
perhaps at first be stared and grinned at by the vulgar;
but they will soon become reconciled to you, and regard
you no more than your brethren of the angle and of the
gun. Things that are unusual are too often esteemed
ridiculous; and the philosopher whose object is to collect
and study the wonderful works of his <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, is often
regarded by the ignorant plebeian as little short of a
madman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Such is the apparatus to be provided by the entomological
Nimrod: it is not often, however, that it will be
necessary, except in distant excursions, to encumber and
disfigure yourself with the whole. Even in this pursuit
more may be effected by a judicious division of labour,
than by grasping at every thing at once; and your acquisitions
will in the end be more numerous, and your
acquaintance with them more intimate, if at one time
you devote yourself to the woods and hedges, another
to the plains and meadows, a third to any heaths in your
vicinity, and a fourth to the collection of aquatic insects
whether from stagnant or running waters:&mdash;having thus
chosen the scene of action, you may equip yourself accordingly.
You will of course, though in pursuit of a
particular description of game, not neglect to seize any
other insects that fall in your way; but for this purpose
it is unnecessary to be always provided with a certain instrument.
Dr. Franklin used to say that a man would
never make a Natural Philosopher, who, in performing
his experiments, could not saw with a gimblet or bore
with a saw; and so we may say, he will never make an
expert collector of insects, who on occasion cannot fish
with his hand or forceps, use his hat or an old letter to
beat his game into, or, in the absence of boxes or bottles,
contrive to secure his captures in small pieces of paper
twisted up. Sparrman, when at the Cape, was wont,&mdash;to
the no small amazement of the wondering natives, who
took him for a conjurer,&mdash;to stick his impaled insects
round the outside of his hat<a name="FNanchor_1563_1563" id="FNanchor_1563_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a>: and though I should not
recommend such an exhibition in a civilized region, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
has often struck me that the cavity of a modern hat, if
lined with cork, might be made a very useful receptacle
for these animals in a long excursion. Indeed, an active
Entomologist is never at a loss for an apparatus, but
often makes his most valuable captures when unprovided
with other instruments than his hands and eyes. A
careful survey of the trunk and branches of trees and
shrubs, particularly of the underside of their leaves,
seldom fails to detect many a lurking moth or beetle,
which may be transfixed or otherwise captured with
little trouble by an expert hand. In this way an ingenious
collector, who scarcely knew what a net of any
kind was, told me he had made his whole collection,
which was rather extensive. It is, in fact, only by thus
detecting them when reposing, and adroitly shutting them
up along with the leaf on which they sit, in a box, that
minute moths (whose beauty and freshness the slightest
handling destroys) can ordinarily be taken without being
injured. The boxes containing them should afterwards
be exposed to the action of heat, a low degree of which
will destroy them.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Enough has been said upon the best modes of <i>catching</i>
insects:&mdash;I shall next attempt to give you some further
instructions as to the most effectual one of <i>destroying</i>
them when caught, and to point out how you are to proceed
with them after they are dead. As I sufficiently
rebutted the charge of cruelty in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_1564_1564" id="FNanchor_1564_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a>, it will
not be necessary to enter here into that subject.
</p>

<p>
I have before recommended to you the use of <i>spirits</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
<i>of wine</i>, and shall here repeat my recommendation; for
after several years trial, I am of Böhm's opinion, who
had tried it nine years<a name="FNanchor_1565_1565" id="FNanchor_1565_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a>, that it is superior to any other
method; particularly, because it not only effectually kills
the insects, and they may be put together into it while
you are collecting, if you have no reason for keeping
them separate, of all sorts and sizes, in a wide-mouthed
phial, without danger of their devouring each other:
but when you come home wearied with a long day's
hunt, you may let your insects remain in it without injury
till the next morning. In collecting beetles abroad,
when there is a want of store-boxes the readiest way is
to put them into a wide-mouthed bottle or jar filled with
any spirit, and send them home in it: some few may
lose their colours, or become greasy; but in general they
will receive little injury. This method saves room, and
avoids the risk of breakage. The derangement which
some hairy species sustain from this method may be readily
repaired by brushing them with a dry camel's-hair
pencil.
</p>

<p>
When you wish to take the insects you have immersed
in spirits out of the phial, you must strain its contents
through a piece of muslin, return the spirit into it for
future use, and spread the insects <i>separately</i> upon blotting-paper,
to absorb the moisture remaining about them.
With regard to such as you have in boxes or phials without
spirit, these must be immersed in a basin of <i>boiling</i>
water. First empty into it the contents of your boxes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
and next, those of your phials; giving each, before you
take out the cork, a smart rap, that the insects adhering
to the latter may drop to the bottom: or you may immerse
the phial itself, with the cork in, which soon destroys
them, and is the safest plan. This done, with a
camel's-hair pencil or feather take them out of the water,
lay them upon blotting-paper to dry, and put them by for
a few hours till you have leisure to impale and set them.
</p>

<p>
Those insects that are caught by the <i>forceps</i> would for
the most part escape you, were you to attempt to get
them out before you had transfixed them. You must
therefore do this while the leaves of the instrument are
closed; and then opening them, and taking the pin by
the point, the head will readily pass through the catgut;
and thus you may safely take, and more effectually kill
your specimen by pressing it as before directed. With
respect to <i>Lepidoptera</i>, it is necessary to disable them
while yet in the fly-net, immediately after their capture.
To effect this, while one hand holds both the rods of the
closed net, with the other stretch the gauze so as to confine
your insect within a narrow space; bring its wings
into an erect position, and prevent its fluttering: which
being done, with your finger and thumb give its breast a
strong pinch below the wings; and then unfolding your
net, and taking it up by one of its antennæ, place it
between the finger and thumb of your left hand, stick a
pin through it, and deposit it in your pocket-box.
</p>

<p>
But though nipping the breast will kill many small
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, the larger ones will live long after it; as will
likewise many <i>Neuroptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, and <i>Diptera</i>:
and besides this, in some <i>Bombycidæ</i> the thorax presents
a very conspicuous and interesting character, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
renders it desirable, in order to avoid the damage or derangement
occasioned by pressure, to transfix them without
it. To dispatch these effectually, you will find the
following apparatus very convenient. Fix in a small tin
saucepan<a name="FNanchor_1566_1566" id="FNanchor_1566_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a> filled with boiling water, a tin tube consisting
of two pieces<a name="FNanchor_1567_1567" id="FNanchor_1567_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a> that fit into each other; cover the mouth
of the lower one<a name="FNanchor_1568_1568" id="FNanchor_1568_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a> with a piece of gauze or canvass, and
place your insects upon it; then fix the upper one<a name="FNanchor_1569_1569" id="FNanchor_1569_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a> over
it, and cover also the mouth of this with gauze, &amp;c.; and
the steam from the boiling water will effectually kill your
insects without injuring their plumage. There is another
more simple mode of doing this, the apparatus for which
may be met with every where. Fix a piece or two of
elder, willow, or any soft wood, with the bark on, across
the bottom of a mug, and on this stick your impaled insects;
invert the mug in a deep basin, into which pour
boiling water till it is covered, holding it down with a
knife, &amp;c., that the expansion of the included air may
not overturn it. In two minutes, or less, all the insects
will be found quite dead, and not at all wetted. If the
sticks do not exactly fit, they may be wedged in with a
piece of cork. Professor Peck, who used to put minute
insects into the hollow of a quill stopped with a piece of
wood made to fit, killed them instantaneously by holding
it over the flame of a candle.
</p>

<p>
Having killed your insects, your next object should
be to prepare them for your cabinet. First, place by
you a pincushion well stored with lace-pins of various
magnitudes and lengths: for most insects those nearly
an inch in length, for large ones, those that are thicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
and longer, but for <i>Lepidoptera</i>, a stouter kind, as <i>short
whites</i>, are best. Next, take the <i>Coleoptera</i> and <i>Hemiptera</i>
that, as before directed, you have laid by on
blotting-paper after immersion, and begin your operations,
selecting the largest first. The pin should be
stuck through the middle of the right-hand elytrum<a name="FNanchor_1570_1570" id="FNanchor_1570_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a>,
and about <i>one third</i> of its whole length should emerge
above the insect. Some <i>foreign</i> collectors, probably
having in view its more convenient examination with a
microscope under the glass of a drawer, bring it nearer
the head of the pin: while the <i>English</i> ones, on the contrary,
studying the most ornamental position of their
specimens, leave only enough of the point free to fix
them safely in their drawers<a name="FNanchor_1571_1571" id="FNanchor_1571_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a>. Both these methods are
open to objection. When the insect is too near the head
of the pin, it is difficult to fix it in your cabinet without
bending the wire; and there is danger, without great
care, of injuring the specimen when you put it in or take
it out. Again: When the legs of your insect rest on the
surface they collect the dust and dirt, are very liable to
be broken, and the length of the pin above it is inconvenient
when you have occasion to examine any one
under a lens. <i>Lepidoptera</i>, however, which are never
thus examined, may always be transfixed in this way,
which sets them off to the greatest advantage.
</p>

<p>
Some insects, especially of the beetle tribe, are so extremely
minute that it is next to an impossibility to get
a pin through them without injuring, and often destroying
them. By using fine needles, or very slender pins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
manufactured on purpose, this difficulty might perhaps
be surmounted; but the needles will be subject to
rust, and the pins, I know by experience, cannot be
fixed in cork without difficulty. For such minute insects,
therefore, by far the best mode is to <i>gum</i> them on small
pieces of card, which may be stuck upon a pin. Talc,
which admits the underside of an insect to be seen
through it, has been used for this purpose; and where
you have only a single specimen, a thin small lamina of
it would answer well; but ordinarily I should recommend
the former mode. Your pieces of card, which
must be small, may be either oblong and cut at the
corners for neatness, with a couple of specimens gummed
upon each, one on its belly and the other on its back;
or you may cut little narrow card wedges, about four
lines long and terminating in a point, upon which you
may so gum your insects as to show the principal part
of the under side, as well as the upper side of its body.
Common gum-water made rather thin, with a very
little glue mixed with it, will answer your purpose very
well: it should be thinly spread on the card with a
camel's-hair pencil, and then the insect placed upon it.
With the same implement, if it has not been killed too
long, before the gum is dry you may expand its antennæ,
palpi, legs, and wings, &amp;c. If you want to remove a
specimen gummed on a card for any purpose, it is easily
effected by plunging it into hot water.
</p>

<p>
Other insects may be transfixed through the thorax
or upper side of the trunk; as also those <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>,
and <i>Hemiptera</i>, whose wings you are desirous
of expanding; only you should be careful that your pin
passes through them <i>behind</i> the <i>prothorax</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Having impaled your insects, the next thing to be
done is to <i>set</i> them. The best time for doing this is not
till they have begun to stiffen, but before they are become
quite stiff. If attempted soon after they are killed, the
parts, unless you keep them in the intended position by
means of pins or braces, will not retain it; and if after
they are become too stiff, they are liable to be broken.
Not only should the antennæ and palpi be extended so
as to be readily seen; but the legs, and often the wings,
ought to be placed in their natural position; all of which
tends much to the beauty of your specimens, and adapts
them for more ready examination. But as this operation
requires time, and beauty and regularity may be purchased
too dear if at the price of hours called for by
science, you may be left to your own discretion in this
business, only you should always with a pin expand the
antennæ and palpi if possible. You might, however,
both save your time and have your insects neatly set, if
you would take the trouble to instruct some acute and
handy youth in your neighbourhood in the <i>modus operandi</i>,
and devolve this department upon him: and as
none are quicker and more expert in capturing insects
than boys, he might also assist you in your hunting expeditions.
</p>

<p>
I do not mean, however, to leave you at liberty with
regard to the setting of <i>Lepidopterous</i> insects, which not
only have a much worse appearance than those of other
Orders if their wings be not regularly and uniformly
expanded, but require it for the proper display of their
characters. The necessary apparatus consists of a piece
of cork about nine inches long, four broad, and half an
inch thick, which should be made perfectly smooth, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
a piece of white paper pasted over it; and of several
narrow slips of card or braces, tapering gradually to a
point, of different lengths, from half an inch to two inches
or more, with a pin fixed in each at the broadest end.
Thus provided, you may proceed to action. But you must
first decide whether, like the continental Entomologists,
you will set your <i>Lepidoptera</i> horizontally; or, like the
British, with their wings declining obliquely from the
body. If you prefer the former method, the body must
be let into a groove, and the wings expanded as flatly as
possible, the anterior margin of the primary pair being
brought forward so as to project beyond the head. But
as this usually gives the insect an unnatural and formal
appearance, I apprehend a man of your taste will prefer
the mode adopted by your compatriots, the collectors of
Britain, who in setting make the wings form an angle,
varying according to the size and characters of the insect,
with the body, and do not bring the anterior wings so
forward. The wings of butterflies however, in order to
appear at all natural, should be set more horizontally.
Which fashion soever you prefer, the mode of operating
is nearly the same; only that the English plan, except in
the case of some large-bodied moths or hawk-moths, requires
no groove in the setting-board. After you have
stuck the insect upon the cork so as to bring its body
close to its surface, stretch the anterior wing with a needle
fixed in a handle, or a camel's-hair pencil, applied to the
joint at the base, sufficiently forward, and then confine
it by means of one of your card braces:&mdash;next, do the
same by the opposite wing. Afterwards expand the posterior
wings, which must not be separated from the anterior
so as to leave any interval between them, and fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
them with braces. When you are become expert, you
will find, if the fly is not large, that a single brace will be
sufficient for each pair of wings<a name="FNanchor_1572_1572" id="FNanchor_1572_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a>: but sometimes, if the
card be not sufficiently stiff, you may confine it by a pin
near the point. You must be careful in expanding the
wings that each is brought equally forward. Lastly,
give the antennæ their proper position, and if necessary
confine them with braces; and leave your specimen in
an airy situation to dry and stiffen. In a few days the
braces may be removed, and the specimen transferred to
the cabinet. When you put them away to become stiff,
you must be careful to place them and your other insects
at <i>night</i> where earwigs cannot come at them; for in sultry
weather these animals will often then attack and spoil
them.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that this process can only be performed
while the joints and ligaments of the insect are still
flexible; so that small species, in warm weather, will
often be immoveably rigid before you can have an opportunity
of setting them. On this account collectors
usually set minute moths as soon as taken, which can be
readily done on the lid of a cork-lined box. But fortunately
both these, and specimens which have been
dried for years, may be relaxed and rendered pliable by
a very simple process. Fill a basin more than half full
of sand, and saturate it with water; pour off the superfluous
water, and cover the sand with blotting-paper:
into this stick the insects you wish to relax, and covering
the basin closely, leave them there for two or three
days, according to their size; and the evaporation will
render them sufficiently flexible for expansion or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
other purpose. Beetles may be relaxed by plunging
them for a short time in warm water or spirits of wine<a name="FNanchor_1573_1573" id="FNanchor_1573_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a>.
</p>

<p>
Many moths of the tribe of <i>Tinea</i> L. are so extremely
minute, that it is almost impossible to set them without
defacing their characters: indeed, the trunk of some is
so small as not to admit being pierced by a pin. These,
therefore, it is adviseable merely to gum upon card, expanding
their wings (which the gum will easily retain in
their proper situation) with a camel's-hair pencil. If
you have two specimens, you may fix one in the natural
position when at rest,&mdash;a method I should recommend
with respect to other <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and indeed insects in
general. Pezold advises that, by way of contrast, <i>white</i>
card should be used for <i>dark</i>-coloured species of these
little moths, and <i>black</i> for such as are <i>pale</i>. As the
wings of different <i>Coleopterous</i> groups, as well as those of
<i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c., vary in their neuration<a name="FNanchor_1574_1574" id="FNanchor_1574_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a>,
you should, whenever you can, set open the elytra and
expand the wings of one specimen at least in each group,
which will be very important to you in making out the
characters of your genera.
</p>

<p>
When sufficiently dried, your insects should be transferred
from the setting-boards, either to their place in
your cabinet or to the store-box before described, till
you have leisure to investigate them.
</p>

<p>
However tedious some of the foregoing manipulations
may seem, they are in fact much less so than those required
in several other branches of Natural History,
where, in addition to the labour of catching, the nice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
difficult task of clearing the skeleton of its muscular covering,
and its internal cavity of its contents, and then of
stuffing it and replacing its perished eyes by glass ones
of the proper colour, is a necessary process with every
individual. Happily the Entomologist, from the smallness
of his game and the nature of their integument, is
usually spared this labour. There are some few insects,
however, in which a process in some degree analogous
is requisite, if the beauty of the specimens be a consideration.
Thus the abdomen of <i>dragon-flies</i> is very apt to
lose its colour, and that of the <i>Meloës</i> to shrink up, if
left in their natural state: these therefore should be
eviscerated; which may be done by slitting the abdomen
longitudinally on the <i>under</i> side, then carefully removing
its contents, and stuffing it with cotton. In the former,
a small straw or stalk of hay may be used, which will
prevent the fractures to which that part, when dry, is so
liable. <i>Spiders</i>, and a few <i>apterous</i> genera, as well as almost
all <i>larvæ</i>, as they usually shrink up, in drying, into a
shapeless mass, destitute of every character dependent on
colour or form, require to be preserved in a different manner.
They may all be very well kept in rectified spirits of
wine mixed with water, in the proportion of three parts
of the former to one of the latter. Each, suspended by
a thread, should be put in a separate very small labelled
phial. Larger spiders, such as <i>Mygale aviculare</i>, &amp;c.,
when suffered to dry, though the abdomen shrinks, do
not wholly lose their characters, and are often kept in
cabinets: but if preserved in spirits, they may be put
into larger wide-mouthed bottles, suspended at different
heights, with a label on the outside opposite to each species.
Mr. Abbott of Georgia had an excellent method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
of preserving <i>caterpillars</i>, so that his specimens retain
their colours and other attributes, and look as if they
were alive. I am not acquainted with his process, but
the following will answer very well.&mdash;The animal must
first be killed by immersion in spirits of wine; next you
must eviscerate it, which is best effected by gradual pressure
of the finger and thumb. You must begin at the
head, and so proceed till all the fluid contents of the
body have passed out at the anus, which you may enlarge
with a fine pair of scissors, being careful not to injure
the anal prolegs. When you have cleared the skin as
much as possible, introduce a fine glass tube, or a piece
of hay or slender straw into the anus, round which, as
near to the extremity as may be, pass loosely a fine
thread: then blowing through the tube, when the skin is
fully inflated withdraw it, at the same time pulling the
thread tight and securing it by a knot. The caterpillar
will now exhibit its proper shape and colours; to retain
which, all that is necessary is to hold it near the flame of
a lamp until perfectly dry, which will be in a few minutes,
when it may be placed in the cabinet along with
the imago to which it belongs<a name="FNanchor_1575_1575" id="FNanchor_1575_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a>.

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Although a very large proportion of the insect inhabitants
of any country may be captured in their <i>perfect</i>
state by the active Entomologist, yet there is no small
number of them that probably he may never meet with
in that state, and to secure which he must have recourse
to other methods. He can procure <i>pupæ</i> by digging for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
them in woods, under trees, &amp;c., as above directed<a name="FNanchor_1576_1576" id="FNanchor_1576_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a>,
keeping them in some of their native earth till they are
disclosed; or he must collect <i>larvæ</i>, and <i>breed</i> them; for
which I shall now give you some instructions.&mdash;The insects
we are particularly concerned with under this head
are the caterpillars of <i>Lepidoptera</i> and of the saw-flies
(<i>Serrifera</i>). If, however, in our entomological rambles
we discover the larvæ of insects of <i>other</i> Orders
upon their appropriate food, we may often attempt to
breed them with success: but as you will seldom thus
get species that you will not also meet with in their
imago state, and the general directions for breeding will
include almost all, I shall principally consider the best
mode of breeding <i>caterpillars</i>, and <i>pseudo-caterpillars</i>.
The first thing is to collect them. In beating the trees,
bushes, and plants, while hunting for <i>Coleoptera</i>, &amp;c., the
Entomologist will often displace caterpillars, which, if
unknown, he should put into a pill-box with a portion of
their food: but <i>Lepidopterists</i> often sally into the woods,
&amp;c., for the express purpose of collecting these only.
When engaged in this employment, the best plan is to
take a sheet with you, and when you mean to beat the
branches of any tree, place it as near them as you can,
upon four or more sticks fastened in the ground, so as
to leave the upper surface concave, and it will receive
the falling caterpillars when you beat. If you aim at
the pseudo-caterpillars of the <i>Cimbicidæ</i>, you must turn
your attention principally to the different species of sallows
and willows (<i>Salix</i>). Your spoils you will put into
boxes with their food, as above directed, to bring them
home.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
There are several kinds of boxes recommended to receive
them and breed them in. If your only object is to
get the perfect insect, a cubical box of moderate dimensions,
glazed in front or on one side to enable you to
watch their proceedings, with the other sides and top
fitted with fine canvass for the admission of air, will very
well answer this purpose; or your box may be canvassed
all round, with a door in front<a name="FNanchor_1577_1577" id="FNanchor_1577_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a>. In this you may place
a small garden-pot filled with earth, with a phial of
water plunged in it to receive the insects' food. This
may be moved, when you wish to change the water,
without disturbing the earth, which should be kept somewhat
moist. The earth is for those caterpillars whose
pupæ are subterranean. But as you will probably wish
to proceed scientifically, and ascertain precisely the moth
that comes from each caterpillar, I should strongly recommend
to you a box invented by Mr. Stephens, which
he describes in a letter to me in nearly these words:&mdash;"The
length of the box is 20 inches, height 12, and
breadth 6; and it is divided into <i>five</i> compartments. Its
lower half is constructed intirely of wood, and the upper
of coarse gauze stretched upon wooden or wire frames:
each compartment has a separate door, and is moreover
furnished with a phial in the centre for the purpose of
containing water, in which the food is kept fresh; and is
half-filled with a mixture of fine earth and the dust from
the inside of rotten trees; the latter article being added
for the purpose of rendering the former less binding upon
the pupæ, as well as being highly important for the use
of such larvæ as construct their cocoons of rotten wood.
The chief advantages of a breeding cage of the above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
construction are, the occupation of less room than five
separate cages, and a diminution of expense; both important
considerations when any person is engaged extensively
in rearing insects. Whatever be the construction
of the box, it is highly necessary that the larvæ be
constantly supplied with fresh food, and that the earth at
the bottom should be kept damp. To accomplish the
latter object, I keep a thick layer of moss upon the surface,
which I take out occasionally (perhaps once a week
during hot weather, and once a fortnight or three weeks
in winter), and saturate completely with water, and return
it to its place: this keeps up a sufficient supply of moisture,
without allowing the earth to become too wet, which is
equally injurious to the pupæ with too much aridity. By
numbering the cells, and keeping a register corresponding
with the numbers, the history of any particular larva
or brood may be traced."
</p>

<p>
In attending to your insects in their cells, your expectations
will sometimes be disappointed, when, instead of a
butterfly or moth, you find only an <i>Ichneumon</i>. But this
you must not regard as <i>all</i> misfortune; for by this means
you will be better instructed in the history of each species,
and learn to the attack of what enemies it is exposed:
and thus you may get many species of these parasitic devourers
of insects that you would not elsewhere meet
with. If your caterpillars, however, appear to be of a
rare kind, you must watch, and often examine them; and
if you discover black specks upon any one, that appear
unnatural or like nits, they may be extracted, Mr. Haworth
assures us<a name="FNanchor_1578_1578" id="FNanchor_1578_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a>, by a pair of small pliers; and if the
operation is adroitly performed, the caterpillar will recover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
and do well. You will often meet Lepidopterous
larvæ travelling over roads and pathways: at such times
they have usually done feeding, and are seeking a spot
in which they may assume the pupa with safety. These
you may place in one of your cells, and they will select
a station for themselves. You must be careful frequently
to examine the boxes in which you have pupæ, that you
may take the imago as soon as it appears, and before it
has had time to injure itself in attempting to escape. I
mentioned to you on a former occasion Reaumur's experiments
to accelerate the appearance of the butterfly<a name="FNanchor_1579_1579" id="FNanchor_1579_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a>;&mdash;there
is another still more remarkable, to which he had
recourse for this purpose: it was by hatching his pupæ
under a <i>hen</i>!! You will wonder, perhaps, how this
could be effected, and be disposed to maintain that the
pupæ must be crushed by the weight of the brooding
animal. How did the ingenious and illustrious experimentalist
prevent this? He prepared a hollow ball of
glass, open at one end, about the shape and size of a
turkey's egg. Having several chrysalises of the nettle-butterfly
(<i>Vanessa Urticæ</i>) suspended to a piece of paper,
he cut out some of these singly, with a square portion of
the paper attached to them, and covered with paste the
side opposite to that from which the chrysalis was suspended:
these he introduced into the ball through the
aperture, placing them as near to each other as possible,
taking care so to apply the pasted surface to the inside of
the ball, that when the side to which they were fixed was
uppermost they all hung as from a vault. This being
done, he stopped the aperture with a linen plug, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
so completely as to cut off all communication with the
atmosphere: he next placed the egg under a hen that
had been sitting some days, who always kept it at the
side of the nest, where it nevertheless derived benefit
from her incubation. After the first day its interior
was covered with vapour transpired by the chrysalises.
Upon this Reaumur took the egg, and removing the
linen plug it soon became dry again: he replaced it
under the hen, and no vapour afterwards appeared. In
about <i>four</i> days the first butterfly ever hatched under a
hen made its appearance; it would probably have required
<i>fourteen</i> under ordinary circumstances. He tried
the same experiment with some Dipterous pupæ; but the
heat was too great for them, and they all perished<a name="FNanchor_1580_1580" id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a>.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
Having properly prepared and set your specimens as
above directed, the next step, when they have remained
a sufficient time to be perfectly dry, is to place them in
your cabinet. If you collect <i>foreign</i> insects as well as
British, you may either preserve the latter in a separate
cabinet, or keep both in the same, distinguishing the indigenous
species by a particular mark. The letter B in
red ink, if the pin which transfixes the insect be run
through it, or, in the case of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, placed before
the specimen, would be a very distinct and sufficient indication
of them. The drawers of your cabinets should
be about 18 inches square, and from the glass to the
corked bottom about an inch and a half in depth: but
the larger <i>Dynastidæ</i>, as <i>Megasoma Actæon</i>, &amp;c., will require
<i>two</i> inches. The frame of the glass should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
rabbeted underneath; and parallel with the sides of the
drawer, but a little lower, there should be inner side-pieces
fixed, so as to form a cavity all round of a proper
width to closely receive the rabbet, and likewise to contain
the camphor for preserving your insects from the
attack of mites, &amp;c.; to emit the scent of which, many
holes should be bored in the side-pieces. Each cabinet
may contain <i>forty</i> of these drawers in a double series,
protected by folding doors; and you may place one cabinet
upon another, if your space admits it. You will
find a tool used by bell-hangers for cutting their wire
very convenient to behead or otherwise curtail the pins,
as those with which foreign insects are transfixed are
often too long. If you cut them off below the insect, cut
them obliquely, which will leave a point that will enter
the cork.
</p>

<p>
When your drawers are <i>smoothly</i> corked<a name="FNanchor_1581_1581" id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> and neatly
papered, first divide each transversely by a <i>full</i> black
line; parallel with this, on each side, draw a line with
red ink: then, for arranging your insects, draw <i>pencil</i>
lines, which are easily obliterated, at right angles with
the others, according to the general size of the insects
that are to occupy them. Insects look better thus arranged
in double columns, than if the pencil lines traversed
the whole width of the drawers. In arranging
them, you may either place them in a straight line <i>between</i>
the pencil lines,&mdash;which I think is best,&mdash;or <i>upon</i>
them. You will begin your columns from the red lines
in the middle, and not from the sides of the drawer; thus
the heads of those on one side of it will be in an opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
direction to those on the other. Where your pins are very
fine and weak, you must make a hole first with a common
lace-pin; otherwise, in forcing them into the cork,
they will bend. In labelling your specimens, you should
stick the appellation of the genus or subgenus with a
pin before the species that belong to it. As to the species
themselves, you may either number them 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.,
sticking the pin they are upon through the number, and
denoting them by a corresponding one in your catalogue;
or you may at once write the trivial name, with the initial
of the genus upon a label transfixed in the same
manner. <i>Lepidoptera</i> cannot easily be arranged in columns.
Perhaps if <i>squares</i>, corresponding with the size
and number of the specimens of any given species you
wish to preserve, were made with pencil, a label of the
trivial name of the species, or a number being placed at
its head, it would be as good a way as any other. But
every one must be left to his own taste in these matters.
Wherever you can, procure a specimen of each <i>sex</i> of
an insect, and where <i>important</i> characters require it, let
some of your Lepidopterous specimens exhibit the <i>under
side</i> of the wings.
</p>

<p>
In arranging insects in your cabinet, if you wish to
have it scientific, as much as the nature of the subject
will admit, follow the series of <i>affinities</i>; but you may reserve
a few drawers to place in contrast <i>analogous</i> forms.
As your numbers of species increase you will have to alter
your arrangement; but as pencil lines are easily rubbed
out, this will occasion you less trouble than if they were
drawn with ink. You should always be careful under
each genus to leave space for new species.
</p>

<p>
As certain <i>Acarina</i>, <i>Tineidæ</i>, <i>Ptinidæ</i>, &amp;c., prey upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
dead insects, you will of course wish to know how they
may be kept out of your drawers, or banished when detected
there. <i>Camphor</i> is the general remedy recommended.
The cavity closed by the rabbet of the glass
frame affords a good receptacle for this necessary article:
put some roughly powdered into each side, and be careful
to renew it when evaporated. This will generally
preserve your insects, as will be seen from the result of
the following experiment.&mdash;Some insects in a chip box
having become much infested by mites and <i>Psocus pulsatorius</i>,
I placed under a wine-glass several of each
along with roughly-powdered camphor: at the end of
twenty-four hours the mites were alive; but at the end
of forty-eight they were all apparently dead, and did not
revive upon the removal of the camphor. The specimens
of <i>Psocus</i> all appeared dead in an hour, and never
revived. If the camphor be put only into one side of a
drawer, and in a lump, though perhaps it may keep out
mites, &amp;c., it will not expel them.

<h3><i>INVESTIGATION OF INSECTS.</i></h3>

<p>
An entomologist who aspires to more than the character
of a mere amateur, will not be content with filling
his cabinet with nameless objects for the sole amusement
of the eye; but will also be anxious to acquire
some knowledge of what he has collected, and to ascertain
by what <i>names</i>, whether indicating their genus or
species, they have been distinguished by scientific writers
who have described insects either in general or those of
particular districts. Thus only can he himself derive
profit from any discoveries he may make, or contribute
to the further progress of the science<a name="FNanchor_1582_1582" id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a>.
</p>

<p>
But in order to accomplish this object effectually, you
must remember and practise the <i>Onslow</i> motto&mdash;<i>Festina
lente</i>:&mdash;you must not be too eager to name your <i>species</i>,
but begin first with <i>grouping</i> your collection. The only
way to acquire, in any degree, a correct knowledge of
the Natural System, or of the general plan of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>,
which is the <i>primum</i> and <i>ultimum</i> of true science,
is by studying <i>groups</i>. The knowledge of species is indeed
indispensable for the registry of facts and other
practical purposes, but the knowledge of groups leads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
to a higher wisdom; and indeed it is through these that
we best descend to the study of species.
</p>

<p>
I will suppose you have made yourself master of so
much of the technical language, particularly the names
and most important attributes of the principal organs of
insects, as will suffice for understanding descriptions, or
knowing these parts when you see them. I will also
further suppose that what was formerly said on these
subjects has been sufficiently studied, to enable you without
much difficulty or hesitation to say whether any
given object belongs to the Class <i>Insecta</i> or <i>Arachnida</i>,
or to which of their respective Orders<a name="FNanchor_1583_1583" id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a>. You are therefore
qualified to arrange your collection into its <i>primary</i>
groups. But you have seen that many <i>others</i> intervene
between the Order and the genus or species. As the
<i>genera</i> of Linné are mostly primary groups of Orders,
perhaps, setting aside such insects included in them by
him as your eye and their apparent characters convince
you have no claim to a place there, your next best
step would be to make yourself thoroughly acquainted
with them. When you have accurately marshalled
and intimately studied these groups, you will probably
have acquired an eye and a tact, <i>experto crede</i>, for grouping
without book, and may proceed by analysis to resolve
your whole collection, as nearly as possible, into as
many as nature seems to indicate to you. In doing this
you will doubtless at first fall into many errors; but these,
practice and a closer examination will in time enable
you to rectify. Having thus got your groups as near
to nature as you can, you may now have recourse to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
authors, particularly Fabricius and Latreille, who have
subdivided the genera of Linné; and you will see which
of your groups agree with theirs, detect your own errors,
and often theirs, and be enabled to label each of your
genera and higher groups, if already known, with its
modern appellation. You are now qualified also to
enter scientifically into the study of the <i>characters</i> that
distinguish groups, and may proceed, wherever opportunity
is afforded, to examine the <i>trophi</i>, which may
often be displayed sufficiently by the means recommended
in my last letter<a name="FNanchor_1584_1584" id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a>. In this way you may learn also to
know your groups as well by character as by habit, and
be qualified to trace the gradual progress of nature from
form to form; and may look upon yourself as duly prepared
to put the last hand to your labours, and proceed
to the examination of <i>species</i>.
</p>

<p>
It will have occurred to you, in making out your genera
or <i>lowest</i> groups, that some consist of a vastly greater
number of species than others. It seems advisable
therefore, when you apply yourself seriously to ascertain
what described ones your cabinet contains, to begin with
those genera which appear to be poor in them; for here
your labour will be comparatively light, from the small
number you will have to examine; and you will become
practised in the employment before you are called upon
to attack those that overflow. Had Fabricius and
other describers of species taken the trouble to subdivide
the larger groups, as might easily have been done,
into more <i>genera</i> and <i>subgenera</i>, the student would have
been spared a most discouraging labour. To be obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
to compare a single individual with the descriptions of
from 100 to 300 species<a name="FNanchor_1585_1585" id="FNanchor_1585_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a>, to ascertain its name, seems
enough to make you start aside with horror from the
employment, and be content that your species should
remain unnamed, rather than expose yourself to such a
waste of time and patience. But to lessen your alarm
and encourage you to proceed, I must observe to you,
though in a few instances it may be necessary to advert
to the description of every single species in a section,
yet that this is seldom requisite; and where it is,
there are many helps to diminish the labour and abridge
the process. A large number of insects are characterized
by their <i>colour</i>; and it is the practice of all good describers
to begin their definition of the species with that
which predominates, and then to enumerate the variations
from it. Thus, if an insect be all <i>black</i> except the
<i>thorax</i>, <i>antennæ</i>, and <i>legs</i>, you will find it thus characterized,
"<i>Black</i>: <i>with thorax, antennæ, and legs ferruginous</i>";
and so on. Hence, having noticed the predominant
colour of your unknown species, in many genera
you may compare it with the descriptions contained in a
whole page at a single glance, and only read the further
descriptions when the colour agrees. A practised Entomologist
will thus investigate his insects with a rapidity
which to an unlearned bystander would seem impossible.
Though I have instanced <i>colour</i> as being the character
most commonly employed in describing species of insects,
you will readily conceive that in some tribes other
characters afford more prominent distinctions. Thus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
the <i>Dynastidæ</i> and many other Petalocerous beetles, the
principal specific character is derived from the <i>horns</i> or
<i>tubercles</i> that arm the head and thorax: in <i>Lucanus</i>
from the <i>mandibulæ</i>; and in <i>Prionus</i> from the marginal
<i>teeth</i> of the thorax. If the insect, then, you want to
name belongs to any of these genera, having observed
its peculiar characters in this respect, you may ascertain
in a very few minutes whether any already described
exhibit the same. This facility of investigation can be
better acquired by practice than precept, and cannot be
attained all at once. The above hints, however, may be
of some use; and cannot fail to be so, if you always endeavour
to make yourself acquainted by a previous careful
examination with the characters of every new insect
you acquire,&mdash;whether those of form, colour, or sculpture,&mdash;before
you attempt to discover its name in Fabricius
or any other author.
</p>

<p>
When you have made such proficiency in the study
as to be familiar with a few species of each section of an
extensive genus, the labour of investigation will sometimes
be greatly facilitated by attending to that conformity
between the proportions, general aspect, and
figure of a known and an unknown insect, which Naturalists
express by the name of <i>habit</i>, and which, though
easily perceived by a practised eye, is described with
such difficulty. Scientific Entomologists in their descriptions
have usually taken care to place near to each
other, species agreeing in habit. When therefore you
know the name of one species, and find another of the
same general habit, you may commonly take it for
granted that if described at all by your author, it will be
placed near that already known to you. Thus, supposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
you are acquainted with that common weevil <i>Cionus
Scrophulariæ</i>, and find its near relation <i>C. Blattariæ</i>;
instead of comparing it one by one with the 161 species
which compose the <i>Longirostres femoribus dentatis</i> of the
Fabrician genus <i>Rhynchænus</i> in the <i>Systema Eleutheratorum</i>,
you would at once turn to the former, very near
which you would without further trouble discover it.
Fortunate, would it be, could the Entomologist always
depend on thus finding descriptions of allied species in
the neighbourhood of each other; but unhappily the
most distinguished authors have sometimes violated this
important rule, so that we cannot always be certain that
any given species is not elsewhere described than in its
right place. Fabricius in many instances often removes
widely asunder insects not merely related, but which are
in reality scarcely more than varieties of the same species<a name="FNanchor_1586_1586" id="FNanchor_1586_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a>.
In fact, the attention of this celebrated author
was so distracted by the immensity of the materials he
had to arrange, by the distance of the cabinets, in many
cases, from each other, the new species of which he
undertook to describe, and the rapidity with which they
necessarily passed under his eye, that he seems never
to have attained any nice perception of the <i>affinities</i> of
insects.
</p>

<p>
You must not conclude, however, that the investigation
of a new insect is even to an adept always a work of
ease and dispatch. Often, when seemingly ascertained
by the rapid process above indicated, a further inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
will be requisite; the more detailed description must be
read, and figures consulted, before its name can be indisputably
determined. In addition to the difficulty
arising from the insufficient characters frequently given
by Fabricius and the older authors, obstacles arising
from their errors not seldom intervene. Thus they have
sometimes selected for a <i>specific</i> character,&mdash;as in the case
of <i>Megachile centuncularis</i>, <i>Nomada ruficornis</i>, and various
other insects,&mdash;what really only indicates a <i>family</i>.
At other times <i>sexual</i> characters common to many,&mdash;as
in <i>Eucera longicornis</i>, <i>Locusta perspicillata</i>, &amp;c.,&mdash;have
been had recourse to. In these cases, in order satisfactorily
to ascertain your species, you must further consult
the <i>synonyms</i> and <i>habitat</i> given by the original describer,
especially the figures he has referred to. When
all these fail, as they sometimes will, the <i>dernier resort</i>
is a reference to the cabinet containing the original specimen
from which the description was drawn. British
Entomologists possess an invaluable privilege, which
their continental brethren may well envy them, in having
the most liberal access, indulged to them by the learned
President of the Linnean Society, to Linné's collection
of insects, from which a large proportion of the species
he described may be ascertained<a name="FNanchor_1587_1587" id="FNanchor_1587_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a>. Several of the cabinets,
especially the Banksian,&mdash;now the property of the
Linnean Society,&mdash;from which Fabricius described his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
insects, may also still be consulted; and thus many
mistakes rectified, which would otherwise greatly mislead<a name="FNanchor_1588_1588" id="FNanchor_1588_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a>.
</p>

<p>
Though sometimes the limits that separate good species
appear at first very slight, and require a practised
eye to catch them, yet it occasionally happens that considerable
apparent differences may safely be disregarded.
The <i>colour</i> of insects,&mdash;to which unhappily for want of
better characters we are so generally forced to have recourse,&mdash;though
usually constant, is in some species very
variable<a name="FNanchor_1589_1589" id="FNanchor_1589_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a>. This is the case sometimes with <i>whole</i> colours.
Thus <i>Carabus arvensis</i>, <i>P&#339;cilus cupreus</i>, &amp;c., are sometimes
of a copper colour; at others, resemble brass; at
others, they are green or blue, and even black. The
colour of <i>spots</i> also often varies. In some individuals
of <i>Pentatoma oleracea</i> they are pale, and in others red.
The number and shape of spots are also often inconstant.
Many of the species of <i>Coccinella</i> so abound in
these variations, that nothing short of the most careful
examination can enable you to distinguish the species
from the variety. Insects vary also in <i>size</i>: but as this
is never assumed as a specific character, it will not occasion
you much trouble. Where the difference in this
respect between two specimens is very great, the presumption
is that they are specifically distinct. Differences
in <i>sculpture</i> and <i>proportion</i> do not always indicate
different <i>species</i>; this being sometimes, as we have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
above, only a <i>sexual</i> character<a name="FNanchor_1590_1590" id="FNanchor_1590_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a>. Authors also in their
descriptions, in this respect sometimes mislead the young
student. When Linné calls the <i>thorax</i> of <i>Aphodius erraticus</i>
smooth (<i>lævis</i>) he would not expect to find it covered
with impressed puncta, and with a longitudinal
posterior impressed line. Likewise in describing <i>Chlænius
vestitus</i> and <i>nigricornis</i>, Fabricius passes without notice
their punctate surface, so different from that of other
<i>Harpalidæ</i>. Errors of this kind however, it is but fair
to observe, are chiefly to be attributed to the circumstance
that both Linné and Fabricius rarely employed
a <i>microscope</i> in making descriptions; though no one now
attempts this, except where insects are large, without
such an aid.
</p>

<p>
If you ask, How am I to acquire this delicacy of tact
which is to decide when the terms of a specific character
are to be rigidly adhered to, and when taken with a certain
latitude? I answer, In the same way in which a
connoisseur attains the faculty of discerning the works
of different masters in painting;&mdash;by such careful study
of your author as will make you master of his style.
Thus you will soon perceive in what cases expressions
are to be taken literally and strictly, or with some allowance
and abatement.
</p>

<p>
There yet remains more distinctly to be adverted to,
the assistance that may be derived in the investigation of
insects from <i>figures</i>. Generally speaking, these should
never be referred to in the first instance, but be regarded
as a resource when the ordinary methods leave the subject
of inquiry doubtful. Those who begin their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
entomological studies by turning over figures usually end
them there, and never attain to that nameless tact in
making out insects that can only be the result of patient
study. Indeed figures, though often very useful, and
sometimes indispensable, can scarcely ever exhibit those
nice characters, particularly as to sculpture, that distinguish
some insects. Our modern artists, indeed, are remedying
this defect of the art, by giving in many cases
the thorax or elytrum apart, with all its sculptural peculiarities:
but this is not, and cannot be, done so as to represent
every one. But though in general figures should
be your last resort, I know not whether an exception to
the rule may not be advisable with respect to the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
which are more difficult to be intelligibly described
than any other order of insects; while a good
figure exhibits to the eye all those markings and shades,
that scarcely any description can place clearly before the
mind.
</p>

<p>
When every attempt to investigate the name of your
unknown species fails, and you have consequently reason
to believe that it is undescribed, the best mode you can
pursue for retaining that knowledge of its characters,
which from your long investigation you must have acquired,
is to note them down in your <i>entomological
journal</i>, inserting it under its proper genus with a trivial
name of your own. Such a journal you will find almost
a <i>sine qua non</i> for containing a catalogue of your insects,
and to register any observations concerning individuals
you may have had an opportunity of making. With
regard to this journal, I should recommend to you to
get two blank books. One a duodecimo of 200 or 300
pages, to contain the mere catalogue of your insects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
their habitat and localities, or the source from which you
derived them. In this you should number the genera in
Roman capitals, and the species under each by a figure;
leaving considerable space at the end of each genus for
the insertion of new species. The other book should be
of an octavo size, containing 400 or 500 pages. Under
the number of each genus and species you might describe
and figure it, if undescribed; if described, note in
what it varies from the description, and what characters
are overlooked: and in general, insert such observations,
with regard to its economy and habits, as you may have
had an opportunity of making.&mdash;As to foreign insects,
wherever you can, upon <i>good</i> authority, be particular in
indicating the country and station of each specimen.
</p>

<p>
I need not say much to you concerning the microscopes
you should use for the examination of insects, a
common pocket one of three glasses of different powers
will answer every ordinary purpose<a name="FNanchor_1591_1591" id="FNanchor_1591_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a>.

<p>
We have treated hitherto of insects as we find them
now inhabiting our globe: but I must not conclude our
correspondence without taking some notice of those that
are found in a <i>fossil</i> state. Fossil insects may be divided
into those that are found in <i>amber</i>, and those that are
found in <i>other</i> substances.
</p>

<p>
It has been observed with respect to insectiferous amber,
that the greater part of the insects found in it exist
no longer in the countries that produce that amber, and
that in every different locality the insects found in it are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
different. Thus the amber of Sicily contains various
species of <i>Coleoptera</i> not to be met with in other ambers,
while that of the Baltic is rich in <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Neuroptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1592_1592" id="FNanchor_1592_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a>.
It is further observed, that the insects inclosed
in the amber of Prussia, and those figured by Sendelius
in his <i>Historia Succinorum</i>, all belong to genera at this
time found in Europe<a name="FNanchor_1593_1593" id="FNanchor_1593_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a>. Insects of the following genera
are recorded as having been found in this singular substance:
<i>Platypus</i>, <i>Elater</i>, <i>Atractocerus</i>; <i>Gryllus</i>, <i>Mantis</i>;
larvæ of <i>Lepidoptera</i>; <i>Trichoptera</i>; <i>Ephemera</i>, <i>Perla</i>,
<i>Termes</i>; <i>Formica</i>; <i>Tipula</i>, <i>Bibio</i>, <i>Empis</i>; <i>Scolopendra</i>;
and various <i>Arachnida</i><a name="FNanchor_1594_1594" id="FNanchor_1594_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a>. In a piece of amber in my
collection I find <i>Evania</i>, <i>Formica</i>, <i>Chironomus</i>, and some
<i>Arachnida</i>.
</p>

<p>
Fossil insects have also been found in other substances.
Parkinson figures larvæ of <i>Libellulina</i> found in limestone<a name="FNanchor_1595_1595" id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a>;
some <i>Melolonthæ</i> in slate; a <i>Polistes</i> in schistus;
<i>Carabi</i> and <i>Necrobia</i> in vegetable debris: but some of
these rather belong to a comparatively modern formation<a name="FNanchor_1596_1596" id="FNanchor_1596_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a>.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
I observed in the outset of our correspondence, that
we were entering an august temple, exhibiting in its
inmost sanctuary the symbols of the Divine Presence<a name="FNanchor_1597_1597" id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a>.
In proportion as we have penetrated, glory from that
Shechinah has more and more shone forth: and whether
we have considered the uses of insects, their ways and
instincts, their forms and structure, and their arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
in a wondrous and complex system, the <span class="smcap">Wisdom</span>,
<span class="smcap">Power</span> and <span class="smcap">Goodness</span> of their and our <span class="smcap">Creator</span> have
every where been marvellously conspicuous, and calculated
to awaken in us every devotional feeling. If, indeed,
we admire and study these little creatures, or any
other department of nature, without reference to their
<span class="smcap">Creator</span>, and collect and love them merely for <i>themselves</i>,
we shall be in some sense idolaters, and, like the
ancient world, put the <i>works</i> of <span class="smcap">God</span> in his place. But
if, while we admire them and store them up and study
them, we see in them his glory reflected, and in the
<i>creature</i> love the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, the study of them, in conjunction
with that of the written Word, will be highly
beneficial to us, and at the same time that it ministers
to our temporal enjoyment will promote our eternal interests.
</p>

<p>
Taking this view, I cannot better close our correspondence
on the subject that has so long occupied us, than
in the pious words of one of our most admired poets:

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<h3><i>DE GENITALIBUS ET GENERATIONE INSECTORUM.</i></h3>

<p>
Inter tot et tanta <span class="smcap">Optimi Creatoris</span> miracula, quæ
<i>Regnum Animale</i> tantopere illustrant, vix ulla sunt majori
admiratione digna, et Physiologi eruditi introspectione, quam
quæ ad generationem insectorum spectant. Quamvis enim
inter sexûs organa vertebratorum animalium et insectorum
analogia haud parva locum habet; numero tamen, figura et
proportione partium, miro modo sæpius differunt; et organa
insuper plura in insectis reperiuntur quorum in vertebratis
exempla frustra quæsiveris.
</p>

<p>
Hoc argumentum tractando duo sunt imprimis consideranda,
<i>genitalia</i> nempe ipsa utriusque sexûs, et <i>coitus</i>.
</p>

<p>
I. De <i>genitalibus</i> in genere prima observatio erit, "quo minor
horum, habita corporis ratione, moles, eo magis nervorum
systema, et cephalicum imprimis ganglium, predominans fit;
eo major igitur intellectûs facultas (instincto naturali consociata)
reperitur," ut in principibus, <i>Apibus</i> nempe, <i>Formica</i>,
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1599_1599" id="FNanchor_1599_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> In <i>Hymenopteris</i>, iterum, <i>Dipteris</i>, et <i>Neuropteris</i>, hæc
organa maxime retracta sunt; dum in <i>Lepidopteris</i>, <i>Coleopteris</i>,
et <i>Orthopteris</i> (quorum insuper mascula et feminea insigniter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
inter se congruunt<a name="FNanchor_1600_1600" id="FNanchor_1600_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a>), magis exserta jacent<a name="FNanchor_1601_1601" id="FNanchor_1601_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a>. Genitalia plerumque
in extremitate postica abdominis sub <i>ano</i> sita sunt<a name="FNanchor_1602_1602" id="FNanchor_1602_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a>, sed
in <i>Arachnidis</i> et <i>Libellulinis</i> masculis in basi <i>ventris</i>, in <i>Phalangio</i>
sub <i>ore</i>, et in <i>Chilognathis</i> in anteriore corporis parte
subtus latitant<a name="FNanchor_1603_1603" id="FNanchor_1603_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a>. Ubi organa duplicantur, ut <i>testes</i>, semper
symmetrica sunt. Non obliviscendum est quòd in diversis
generibus habitu externo persimili consociatis, imò in diversis
unius generis speciebus genitalia diversa interdum reperiuntur<a name="FNanchor_1604_1604" id="FNanchor_1604_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a>:
sic in Lamellicornibus <i>stercorariis</i> (<i>Scarabæus</i>, <i>Copris</i>,
&amp;c.), testes tantummodo sunt <i>duo</i>; in <i>arboreis</i> (<i>Melolontha</i>,
&amp;c.) <i>duodecim</i>, et in <i>floralibus</i> (<i>Cetonia</i>, &amp;c.) <i>viginti-quatuor</i>.
</p>

<p>
Genitalia sunt vel <i>mascula</i> vel <i>feminea</i>.
</p>

<p>
i. Genitalia <i>mascula</i>, sunt <i>penis</i>; <i>canalis excretorius</i>; <i>vesiculæ
seminales</i>; <i>vasa deferentia</i>; <i>testes</i>; <i>prehensores</i>; et <i>semen</i>.

nudus est, sed in <i>Tephrite</i> fimbriatus. In insectis
proprie dictis <i>simplex</i> est hoc organon, in <i>Scorpionibus</i> autem
<i>duplex</i> evadit; quod fit etiam in quibusdam reptilibus, <i>Serpentibus</i>
nempe et <i>Lacertis</i><a name="FNanchor_1617_1617" id="FNanchor_1617_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a>.
</p>

<p>
2. <i>Canalis excretorius</i> e concursu vesicularum seminalium
formatur, et a <i>pene</i> excipitur in quo terminat et cui semen reddit;
interdum brevissimus est, ut in <i>Blatta</i><a name="FNanchor_1618_1618" id="FNanchor_1618_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a>, et interdum
iterum prælongus, ut in <i>Blapte Mortisaga</i>, <i>Tyrophaga Casei</i>, et
aliis<a name="FNanchor_1619_1619" id="FNanchor_1619_1619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a>. Plerumque cylindricus est, musculosus, compactus, et
externe tracheis pertextus<a name="FNanchor_1620_1620" id="FNanchor_1620_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a>.
</p>

<p>
3. <i>Vesiculæ seminales</i> conniventes formant, ut jam dictum
est, canalem excretorium communem cujus prolongatio bifida
esse videntur; vasa deferentia hinc excipiunt. Interdum vasa
hæc ac vesiculæ seminales eodem loco in canali excretorio
communi terminant, unde canalis hic tumidior fit<a name="FNanchor_1621_1621" id="FNanchor_1621_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a>. Vesiculæ
supradictæ maxime variant: modo canalem exhibent ventricosum,
tortum, implexum, longissimum; modo rectum, breviorem.
In plerisque <i>duæ</i> sunt vesiculæ seminales, etiam in
<i>Lepidopteris</i> monorchidis; in quibusdam (<i>Tenebrione Molitore</i>,
<i>Hydrophilo piceo</i>) <i>quatuor</i><a name="FNanchor_1622_1622" id="FNanchor_1622_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a>; in aliis (<i>Dytisco marginali</i>)

Breves admodum
sunt in <i>Orthopteris</i> et quibusdam <i>Coleopteris</i><a name="FNanchor_1625_1625" id="FNanchor_1625_1625"></a><a href="#Footnote_1625_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a>; sed in aliis
longissimæ; in <i>Orycte nasicorni</i> vicies, et in <i>Cetonia aurata</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
ter decies corpus longitudine superant<a name="FNanchor_1626_1626" id="FNanchor_1626_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a>. In hisce organis
semen e testibus per vasa deferentia acceptum ante emissionem
elaboratur.
</p>

<p>
4. <i>Vasa deferentia</i> ita appellantur quia semen e testibus acceptum
ad vesiculas seminales <i>deferunt</i>. Ex utroque teste
unum vas deferens exit, et si utrinque plures sint testes, ut in
<i>Melolontha</i><a name="FNanchor_1627_1627" id="FNanchor_1627_1627"></a><a href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a>, <i>Cetonia</i>, &amp;c., omnia ad unicum utrinque canalem
formandum confluunt, qui vesiculis supradictis semen reddit:
interdum, ut in <i>Lepidopteris</i><a name="FNanchor_1628_1628" id="FNanchor_1628_1628"></a><a href="#Footnote_1628_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a>, ab his nullo modo separantur,
unum canalem aut tubum formantia; sed in aliis penitus sunt
distincta<a name="FNanchor_1629_1629" id="FNanchor_1629_1629"></a><a href="#Footnote_1629_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a>. Ex eodem filo quo contexuntur testes vasa deferentia
sæpius deducuntur.
</p>

<p>
5. <i>Testes</i> organa sunt semen primum secernentia: variant
<i>compositione</i>, <i>numero</i>, et <i>figura</i>. In quibusdam (<i>Lepidopteris</i> et
<i>Hymenopteris</i>) sunt compacti vasculis visui se subducentibus;
in aliis (<i>Orthopteris</i>, <i>Neuropteris</i>, <i>Dipteris</i>, et quibusdam <i>Coleopteris</i>)
e vasculis brevibus cæcis variique voluminis conformati
sunt, atque tunica densa tenaci vel rete tantum mucoso obducti<a name="FNanchor_1630_1630" id="FNanchor_1630_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_1630_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a>;
vel iterum ex unico variisque modis tecto canali varie
contorto et implexo, qui deduci potest et haud raro massam
ovalem trachearum ope contextam refert, conflantur, ut in
<i>Coleopteris Prædaceis</i> tam aquaticis quam terrestribus<a name="FNanchor_1631_1631" id="FNanchor_1631_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Numero</i> etiam variant testes. Quædam <i>Lepidoptera</i>, ut
<i>Pontia Brassicæ</i>, item <i>Iulidæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1632_1632" id="FNanchor_1632_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_1632_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a>, <i>unico</i> gaudent; pleraque tamen
insecta animalia vertebrata hic æmulantur, et testibus instruuntur
<i>duobus</i>; in <i>Nepa cinerea</i> et reliquis <i>Hemipteris</i> quatuor
vel quinque<a name="FNanchor_1633_1633" id="FNanchor_1633_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1633_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a>, in <i>Melolontha vulgari</i> sex<a name="FNanchor_1634_1634" id="FNanchor_1634_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_1634_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a>, et in <i>Cetonia

pluribus compacti videntur, et bacciformes appellari possunt.
In <i>Lamia</i> duodecim glandulæ in utroque teste coalitæ inveniuntur<a name="FNanchor_1636_1636" id="FNanchor_1636_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a>,

</p>

<p>
Quoad <i>figuram</i>, interdum, ut in <i>Pontia</i> Papilionum genere,
spherici evadunt<a name="FNanchor_1638_1638" id="FNanchor_1638_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a>; in <i>Gryllo</i> pyriformes<a name="FNanchor_1639_1639" id="FNanchor_1639_1639"></a><a href="#Footnote_1639_1639" class="fnanchor">[1639]</a>; in <i>Ape mellifica</i>

</p>

<p>
In <i>larvis</i> etiam hæc organa detegere est. Sic in eruca <i>Pontiæ</i>
quatuor testes sunt utrinque, vel potius unicus ex quatuor
serie ordinatis, conflatus<a name="FNanchor_1643_1643" id="FNanchor_1643_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a>. Hi sensim coacervantur donec
in sphæricum testem antea descriptum coalescant.
</p>

<p>
6. <i>Prehensores</i><a name="FNanchor_1644_1644" id="FNanchor_1644_1644"></a><a href="#Footnote_1644_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> sunt organa figura varia quibuscum mas in
coitu feminæ anum corripit et comprimit. Quoddam analogum
in quibusdam <i>Mammaliis</i>, <i>Avibus</i>, <i>Piscibus</i>, et <i>Reptilibus</i><a name="FNanchor_1645_1645" id="FNanchor_1645_1645"></a><a href="#Footnote_1645_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a>

</p>

<p>
Quoad <i>situm</i>&mdash;circa foramen per quem prodit penis sub ano
plerumque sunt inserti, sed in <i>Conope</i> cornu prehensorium in

est spissum, lacteum, granulis repletum; sub lente punctula

II. <i>Coitus.</i>&mdash;Coitum insectorum tractaturo paucula de lenociniis
amatoriis, et aliis ejusmodi, quæ antecedunt, sunt prædicenda.
<i>Olfactu</i> mares <i>Phalænarum</i> interdum feminam latentem,

<i>Lampyrides</i> et quorundam aliorum insectorum feminæ maritum
ad lectum gramineum prælucent; et huc referri forsan
debet plurium cæcus ardor lumina circumvolandi, vel etiam
in lumen irruendi; <i>sonus</i> excitat feminas <i>Cicadarum</i> et <i>Gryllinarum</i><a name="FNanchor_1667_1667" id="FNanchor_1667_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_1667_1667" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a>,
&amp;c. ad amores, et cantu stridulo querelisque amatoriis
diem ducit mas cupidus, donec sponsa advolat, et tori
foliosi fit haud invita particeps. Sonitu etiam uterque sexus

In plurimis tamen insectis femina fit modestiæ et pudicitiæ
exemplar, et non nisi difficillime et capite averso maris ardori

excitare nos ad laborem indefessum, ad prudentiam item et

feminæ sæpe speciem præ se ferunt pudoris et castitatis,

&#338;stro amoris concitus, mas feminæ collum <i>prehensore</i>
anali triphyllo arripit et avolat, illam quasi prædam
secum gerens; sponsæ sic electæ, persuadere in animo est ut
caudam suam inflecteret, et ad coitum se daret, quod, illa invita,
fieri nequit; maris enim genitalia, ut antea dictum est, in
basi ventris sita, feminæ vero in extremo ano; hinc, nolente
illa, vix fit coitus, et sæpissime longo et vano labore, huc illuc
volando virginem protervam frustra solicitat; sed tandem lacessitus
aquas petit, quas sponsæ cauda longa, me teste, sæpius
flagellat, donec defatigata, et quasi ex frigido calorem
concipiens, demum et sensim caudam inflectit, et se reddit

mares feminas antennarum et abdominis motibus et frictione
lenocinantur et ad coitum provocant.

<p>
Insecta sunt alia, ut <i>Phalænæ</i>, <i>Muscidæ</i> quædam, et <i>Apis
mellifica</i>, in quibus inversa est hæc naturæ lex casta; harum
enim feminæ marem petunt, vel blanditiis alliciunt ad amores.

N.B.&mdash;The reader is requested to observe that in the preceding Index,
one object has been to point out, wherever it was possible, to what Linnean
or Fabrician genus each of the genera included in it may be referred,
though no species of it may have been known to those authors.
Where a Synonym of any genus is printed in <i>Roman</i> letters, it indicates
that such genus is so denominated in the former Editions of this work.
The first namer of a genus, together with any author who has written a
monograph upon it, or on any tribe, and the more eminent systematists,
are usually only quoted. If the reader finds any difference, as is sometimes
the case, between the text and the Index, he will be pleased to
correct the <i>former</i> by the <i>latter</i>.&mdash;For instance, it was not discovered
till too late, that the name <i>Uria</i> was pre-occupied in Ornithology;&mdash;in
the Index this name is altered to <i>Uriata</i>. Doubtful <i>species</i> are printed
in Italics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>

yet still, even making allowance for these, many pairs will appear

<p><a name="Footnote_387_387" id="Footnote_387_387"></a><a href="#FNanchor_387_387"><span class="label">[387]</span></a> Marcel de Serres, in his <i>Observations on the Dorsal Vessel of
Insects</i><a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>, endeavours to prove that the principal use of that vessel
is the more perfect animalization of the chyle that, transuding through
the pores of the intestinal canal, is imbibed by it. In insects, he observes,
that undergo metamorphoses, in which the growth or development
of parts is often very rapid, it is requisite that a considerable
portion of the chyle should be in reserve for this purpose. On this
account it is that the <i>Epiploon</i> or adipose tissue is so abundant in
larvæ to what it is in the perfect insect. That the importance also of
this part to insects is proved by the circumstance, that all their interior
parts communicate by fibrils with this tissue, and that probably
their various organs derive the nutriment from it by their means.
He then asks by which of the viscera is the fat elaborated, or by what
means does the chyle which transudes from the intestinal canal pass
to the state of fat? Facts seem to indicate, says he, that the function
of the dorsal vessel is to pump up the chyle, and to cause it
then to transude through the meshes of the adipose tissue, where it
finishes by elaborating that mass of fat so abundant in larvæ and
certain perfect insects, which are thus enabled to sustain the effects
of a long fast. So that this vessel is only a <i>secretory</i> organ, analogous
to so many others that exist in insects; but the secretion which
it has to produce is the most important of all, since the support of
the vital powers depends upon it: it is, in effect, that vessel which
completes the function of animalization, and which itself prepares the
nutritive fluid<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>. He observes, amongst other reasons he brings to
support his theory, that the colour of the fluid which it contains is
always analogous to that of the adipose tissue that surrounds it, and
that the colour of that tissue never changes without that of the fluid
undergoing a corresponding alteration,&mdash;that when, as in many perfect
insects, the quantity of fat diminishes, the dorsal vessel also diminishes
in size, and that the same reagents which coagulate the fat,
coagulate equally the fluid in the dorsal vessel, which seems to indicate
an identity between them<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>.
</p>
<p>
But there are circumstances that militate against this hypothesis.
The analysis which Lyonet has given of the fluid contained in the
dorsal vessel of the <i>Cossus</i><a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>, seems to prove that it is more analogous to gum or varnish. He saw indeed a few globules, which appeared
ten times as big as the others, which swam upon the water, but which
he did not regard as component parts of the fluid, but as little drops
of grease extravasated by dissection. The fluid of the vessel itself
easily mixed with water, and appeared to sink in it to the bottom<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>.
This proves that it is not of a fatty or oleaginous nature. But the
strongest objection is stated by M. Carus, who judiciously observes<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>,
That it is contradictory to suppose that a canal should absorb or
exude fluids by its parietes in a different form. Further experiments
however seem necessary to ascertain the nature of the fluid and its
object.</p>

has transuded through the intestinal canal, a fluid in <i>repose</i>, which
seems to indicate that it is perfectly <i>stagnant</i>; but when we consider
that it is not only incessantly entering the body and making its way
to every part, but is also, by means of the various secretory organs,
constantly converted into new products, and so going out again in
many cases, it will appear evident that it cannot be considered as a
stagnant fluid, since there must be a constant though probably slow
motion towards the points of absorption or imbibition.</p>

a blind vessel opening into the vagina, and at the other or
inner extremity not terminated by any secretory tube, containing
a yellowish matter, that seems analogous to the organ mentioned
in the text; and in the hive-bee he found a similar organ covered
with air-vessels, which he supposes to be connected with the <i>Colleterium</i>
(see above, p. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>.), and which he states to contain a slimy
matter. <i>Bibl. Nat.</i> i. 151. b. <i>t.</i> xxx. <i>f.</i> 10. <i>g.</i> 204. b. <i>t.</i> xxix. <i>f.</i> 3. <i>t.</i>
Perhaps likewise the organ discovered by M. L. Dufour in <i>Scolia</i>,&mdash;which
he imagines to belong to the poison-secretor, and which he
describes as a sac consisting of a double tunic, the exterior one muscular
and the interior membranous, and filled with a blueish-green
gelatinous matter (<i>N. Dict. d'Hist. Nat.</i> xxx. 388.)&mdash;may be a <i>spermatheca</i>.</p>

of matter for varnishing the eggs or lubricating the oviduct. It
seems most probable, if the fecundation of the eggs takes place gradually,
that upon their passing into the oviduct, a special reservoir
should be appropriated to the reception of the male sperm, adapted to
maintaining in due activity the vivifying principle, or <i>aura seminalis</i>.</p>

from the female, or whether dying immediately after fecundation
they are hatched within her body. As the young larvæ certainly
are hatched in the pupa (not merely within the exterior case
of bits of grass, &amp;c., which includes it) which the body of the insect
must fill, it does not seem easy to conceive how she can find room
for oviposition; and yet Von Scheven expressly says that one female
of <i>Ps. vestita</i>&mdash;which being kept from all access to the male actually
left the pupa-case and wandered about the glass which contained
them&mdash;laid unfruitful eggs.</p>

he consulted Reaumur (v. 418) he would have found that this great
man examined the proceedings of a bee with a magnifying glass,
and distinctly saw her devour very deliberately the masses of pollen
on her hind legs. He says also (Ibid. 419.) that if the stomach and intestines
are opened, they will be found filled with that substance.</p>

<i>series</i> militates somewhat against that of a circle returning
into itself. The progression of the series may be in a circle; but at
the point of contact where the second circle meets the first, the lines
must cut each other; and at this point of intersection of the two circles
are of course the osculant groups constituting the first and the
last of each circle, which in their intervention come in contact with
each other, or rather forming <i>transition</i> groups. If each circle is regarded
as <i>absolute</i>, the <i>series</i> is broken, though the osculant groups
connect the circular ones.</p>

belong to the Order, and as the great body of the <i>Trichoptera</i> are
distinguished by <i>hairy</i> upper wings, I cannot think the name improper:
but to apply a name to a <i>Genus</i> which terminates like the denominations

Catalogue</i> of the Javanese Lepidoptera in the Museum of
the Honourable East India Company, has divided that Order into
<i>five</i> primary groups, apparently to accommodate it to Mr. W. S.
MacLeay's quinary system. I trust he will pardon me for observing,
that in this arrangement he seems to me rather to <i>force</i> than to
<i>follow</i> nature; and that though he adheres to the above system as
to the <i>number</i>, he forsakes it in the <i>construction</i> of his groups.
</p>
<p>
The obvious primary sections of the Lepidoptera, which have
been evident to almost every one who has at all studied the Order,
are the <i>three</i> named in the text, corresponding with Linné's genera
<i>Papilio</i>, <i>Sphinx</i>, and <i>Phalæna</i>. The groups of the last or nocturnal
section, which Dr. Horsfield has elevated to the same rank with the
two first, are evidently not of equal value, nor to be placed upon the
same platform; for the <i>Bombycidæ</i>, <i>Noctuidæ</i>, and <i>Phalænidæ</i>, are
clearly of a <i>secondary</i> rank. Indeed this section is resolvable into
<i>more</i> groups of <i>equal</i> value than the learned Doctor has assigned to
it; for the <i>Tortricidæ</i>, <i>Tineidæ</i>, &amp;c. are not so united to the Geometers,
or genuine <i>Phalænidæ</i>, as to form with them a <i>primary</i> group
of the <i>Nocturnal Lepidoptera</i>, but are themselves entitled <i>separately</i>
to that distinction. This will be evident to every one who will take
the trouble to compare the larvæ and their habits, of the two tribes,
as well as the perfect insects.
</p>
<p>
In the construction of his groups, he seems not to have discovered
in the <i>Lepidoptera</i> a great typical group resolvable into <i>two</i>, or at least he has not built his system on this foundation, which appears
an essential part of the quinary arrangement. (See Mr. W. S. MacLeay
in <i>Linn. Trans.</i> xiv. 56&mdash;.) As to <i>value</i>, the <i>Papilionidæ</i> constitute
the typical group or centre of the Order, though the <i>Phalænidæ</i>
prevail as to <i>numbers</i>: but neither of these are resolvable into
two primary groups.</p>

what Mr. MacLeay calls the <i>aberrant groups</i> are usually also resolvable
into two.</p>

and most important association has been formed, having for
its object the Animal Kingdom solely; which not only has a museum
to receive specimens of dead animals (by the liberal donation of its
present learned secretary, of his own rich collection, and from other
sources, already most interesting both as a spectacle and to the
student), but also a Vivarium, in which a considerable and curious
assemblage of living animals may be seen. This association, which
is named <span class="smcap">The Zoological Society</span>, is principally indebted for its
formation to the efforts of a great, amiable, and lamented character,
the late Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, whose merits were equally
conspicuous both as a Politician and a Naturalist, and who was its

Eleutheratorum</i>, <i>Rhyngotorum</i>, <i>Glossatorum</i>, <i>Piezatorum</i>, and <i>Antliatorum</i>;
to the <i>Genera Crustaceorum et Insectorum</i> of Latreille; to the
same department of the <i>Règne Animal</i> of Cuvier; and to the <i>Animaux
sans Vertèbres</i> of Lamarck. He will find the genera of Linné and Fabricius
illustrated by <i>figures</i>, in R&#339;mer's <i>Genera</i>; and many of the
species described by the latter in Coquebert's <i>Illustratio Iconographica</i>.
In our countryman Drury's beautiful <i>Illustrations of Natural History</i>,
a large number of new and rare insects are depicted; and in Mr. Donovan's
<i>Insects of China, India, and New Holland</i>, some of the most
brilliant and interesting that have been imported from those countries.
Panzer's <i>Faunæ Insectorum Germanicæ Initia</i> has little short of
3000 figures of insects of every Order (a considerable number of which
are found to inhabit Britain), by the celebrated Sturm; and the
latter, in his <i>Deutschlands Fauna</i>, has illustrated many Coleopterous
genera analytically (as has also M. Clairville the weevils and Predaceous
beetles of Switzerland in his <i>Entomologie Helvétique</i>) by his
admirable pencil. Beetles in general are well figured and described
in Olivier's splendid <i>Entomologie</i>; as are those of Europe in a beautiful
work now in course of publication, under the title of <i>Coleoptères
d'Europe</i>, by MM. Latreille and Dejean. The latter author
has also begun a work on this Order under the title of <i>Species général
des Coléoptères de la Collection de M. Le Comte Dejean</i>; two
volumes of which have appeared, containing part of the <i>Carabici</i> Latr.
but I fear it has stopped for want of encouragement. Had the descriptions
been less verbose it would have had a better chance of
success. For the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Hemiptera</i>, the student must have
recourse to Stoll's <i>Spectres</i>, <i>Mantes</i>, <i>Sauterelles</i>, <i>Grillons</i>, <i>Blattes</i>,
<i>Cigales</i>, and <i>Punaises</i>. To a knowledge of the species of <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
the admirable figures of Cramer (<i>Papillons Exotiques de trois Parties</i> <i>du Monde</i>), Esper (<i>Schmetterlinge</i>, <i>Tagschmetterlinge</i>), Hübner
(<i>Schmetterlinge</i>, &amp;c.), and Ochsenheimer's valuable <i>Schmetterlinge
von Europa</i>, with the continuation by Treitschke, will afford a useful
avenue. Meigen also, author of a most valuable work on the
Europæan <i>Diptera</i>, is publishing at this time a work on <i>Lepidoptera</i>
under the title of <i>Europäische Schmetterlinge</i>. To the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
Jurine and Christian are the best guides, and to the <i>Diptera</i>
Meigen.

<p>
With regard to works in British Entomology in general&mdash;Donovan's
<i>Natural History of British Insects</i>, and Samouelle's <i>Entomologist's
Useful Compendium</i>, will be found very excellent helps to the
student. For the British Genera, the most important work that has
yet appeared is Mr. John Curtis's <i>British Entomology</i>, in which not
only are the insects admirably represented, but their trophi correctly
delineated, accompanied by able descriptions. For the <i>Coleoptera</i>
of our country, Mr. Marsham's <i>Entomologia Britannica</i> should be
consulted: for the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the <i>Butterflies</i> of Lewin, Mr. Haworth's
useful <i>Lepidoptera Britannica</i>, and Miss Jermyn's <i>Butterfly-Collector's
Vade Mecum</i>; and for the English species of Linné's genus
<i>Apis</i>, the <i>Monographia Apum Angliæ</i>. A British <i>Fauna Insectorum</i>,
under the title of <i>Illustrations of British Entomology</i>, has at length
been happily begun by a gentleman (J. F. Stephens, Esq.) who both
by his accurate knowledge of the subject, and the extent of his collection
of British Insects, is best qualified to undertake it. As far
as it has proceeded, it is ably executed, and possesses this advantage,
(an advantage seldom to be obtained in works published periodically,)
that it finishes, as far as possible, as it goes.</p>
